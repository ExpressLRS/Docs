Well, ELRS is not \ud83d\ude04, it can be set up for around 60$ (Using second-hand r9 hardware). It also is better than many (higher sensitivity, lower latency\ud83d\udc4c). Is it better than the commercial solutions? \u00b6 It is faster than most links out there with a latency of 6.5ms (at 200hz). At 250hz 100mW 2.4GHz it is capable of ranges 30km+. Which OpenTX version works with ExpressLRS \u00b6 OpenTX 2.3.12 or newer should work just fine. No need to use OpenTX Nightly, unless you have requirements not present in the Stable versions. EdgeTX 2.4.0 or newer should work too. Why do I need to update OpenTX? \u00b6 ExpressLRS needs your radio to support crsfshot (a.k.a. Mixersync) to work properly. This will give you the lowest possible latency and optimal consistency of the RC link. When your radio does not have crsfshot working, this often shows in your ExpressLRS Lua script. The Lua script top bar will show inconsistent numbers like 0:63 or is stuck at 0:250 at every packet rate rate you select. The Lua script top bar should always show a stable 0:[user selected packet rate] For example: 0:50, 0:150, 0:250, 0:500, ... When that is the case your radio has crsfshot working and you're good to go. Click here to read more on OpenTX. How can I flash/update x receiver/module? \u00b6 See Getting Started page Will x Receiver work with y TX Module from z Manufacturer? \u00b6 Any Receiver and TX Module from the same Band (2.4GHz or 900Mhz) will work together. Supported R9 receivers will work with the 900Mhz modules from Happy Model, Namimno RC and the R9M, same with the other 900Mhz receivers, DIY or off-the-shelf. Likewise, any 2.4Ghz receivers should work with any 2.4Ghz TX Modules, from any manufacturer and even the DIY ones. This is as long as they have the same binding phrase and configuration options (Regulatory Domain, Performance Options and Extra Data). What's the difference between the different Happymodel 2.4GHz receivers (PP, EP1, EP2)? \u00b6 The difference between the PP and the EP1/EP2 is only the processor. The PP is the original design and uses an STM32 while the EP1/EP2 use an ESP82xx. Both offer firmware update through Betaflight passthrough, but the EPx also support firmware upload over wifi. The EP1 is the same as the EP2 except it has a U.FL/IPEX1 connector for an external antenna. The wifi capability of the ESP is not used apart from the update procedure, and the wifi is only enabled shortly after power-up if no TX connection is received ( AUTO_WIFI_ON_INTERVAL if bound, 60s otherwise). Receiver performance should be identical between the two. If you're confused by the PP being more expensive, it's because there is a shortage of the STM part. What is required to achieve a 500hz update rate on 2.4ghz on OpenTX? \u00b6 Make sure to enable the \"Use_500hz\" option when you flash the TX and RX. You must also be on a version of OpenTX that supports Mixer Sync (TBS Nightly, ELRS Nightly, OpenTX 2.3.12 or newer, or EdgeTX). USE_500Hz option is now enabled be default starting with 1.0.0-RC9 (6358aa). To confirm your update rate is working as intended, you can use the ExpressLRS Lua script to check the current update rate and confirm you are getting 500hz. How many channels does ELRS support? \u00b6 12 channels(suspicious asterisk). There is not enough bandwidth to support all full-resolution channels (e.g. for pan/tilt servos). It is possible that future versions could include some tricks to expand this by sending extra channel data in a slow upload, but it is not a priority for development. Therefore, ELRS provides: * 4x full-resolution (10-bit) channels for sticks (CH1-4) * Either: * Standard Mode 4x 2-position channels sent every frame (increased to 8x in 1.0), OR * HYBRID_SWITCHES_8 Mode 8x 3-position channels, where CH5 (AUX1/ARM) is sent every frame, and the other 7 are sent round-robin (7 frames to send all channels) also changed in 1.0, see Switch Modes Is my binding phrase a secret? \u00b6 No, just like what channel your VTX is on is not a secret. The binding phrase is not security, it is anti-collision. If everyone kept their VTX channel a secret, the chances of you blasting someone out of the sky accidentally is pretty high. To provide the best chance of not interfering with other pilots and them not interfering with you, be sure you're not using the same dumb bind phrase as someone else. Express your style with a hilarious or saucy bind phrase. What does RQLY, TQLY, RSSI x2, SNR x2 mean? \u00b6 Datapoint Description Range Info RQly Uplink - link quality (valid packets) 0 - 100 The number of successful packets out of the last 100 from TX \u2192 RX 1RSS Uplink - received signal strength antenna 1 (RSSI) -128 - 0 RSSI dBm as reported by the RX.

When the connection is first established, the link quality starts at 0 and climbs as packets are received. Expect low RF Signal warnings until enough packets are reported received to pass your warning threshold set in OpenTX -> Telemetry -> RSSI -> Low alarm / Critical alarm.","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"faq/#why-expresslrs","text":"ExpressLRS is competing with some of the best commercial solutions out there, but all are expensive \ud83d\ude41.

This means you can build a more compact and lightweight whoop or nano long range rig without the need for an external receiver. More of these flight controllers are coming into stores. Because these are SPI-based, the ExpressLRS Code came baked-in in the Betaflight 4.3.0-based custom-built firmware. These usually don't need to be updated. These Flight Controllers will work with any released ExpressLRS firmware. Binding Procedure \u00b6 There are two ways to bind the receiver, as shown below Button Binding \u00b6 Put the receiver into bind mode using any of these procedures: \"Bind\" button in the Betaflight Configurator, Receiver Page (if can't be found, update the Betaflight firmware). using the CLI, type in bind_rx and press enter once. press the bind button on the flight controller. using the CLI, type in set expresslrs_uid = 0 , press enter once, then save and reboot Execute elrs.lua in your handset and press the Bind button. The RX and TX should be now bound. Please mind the order, RX first, TX second. Video Tutorial (thanks to @JyeSmith ): Passphrase \u00b6 Set passphrase in the TX. When building via ExpressLRS Configurator, or via VS Code note down and copy below numbers from the build log: Go to betaflight cli and type (for example): set expresslrs_uid = 172,123,235,247,1,122 save RF Mode Adjustment \u00b6 These AIOs with ExpressLRS SPI Receivers are set to use 500Hz as default. To adjust it, you will need to go into Betaflight CLI and use the following commands: set expresslrs_rate_index = [your index] save Where [your index] corresponds to the following : 500Hz = 0 250Hz = 1 150Hz = 2 50Hz = 3 With the Updated Betaflight firmware, adjusting your packet rate from the Lua Script will also adjust the packet rate in the AIO. Updating \u00b6 As mentioned, there's little need to update, but should you still want to, the update will mean you will reflash your Betaflight firmware into your Flight Controller. In preparation for this, you should save a copy of your diff all dump. Download the necessary binaries (zipped) from this Betaflight PR page . Extract the Hex File and, using Betaflight Configurator 10.8.0 (Nightly), flash the binary using the Load Firmware [Local] button found at the bottom right of the Firmware Flasher (Flight Controller in DFU Mode). Once flashed, you will need to paste in the diff all you have saved. Don't forget to type in save and press enter once done. Power cycle your flight controller, and you should be set. Review your Betaflight settings, and check your RC link. This procedure will only apply while Betaflight 4.3.0 is not yet released.

However some users report it's not working as it should with ExpressLRS. For example: ExpressLRS Lua script just shows Connecting... ExpressLRS Lua script shows unstable behavior, especially on the higher packet rates, showing values different from 0:['SELECTED PACKET RATE'] Constant Telemety Lost/Telemetry Recovered Notification. So what could be wrong? \u00b6 It is possible that the X9D(+) radio also suffers from a slow inverter circuit that messes up the 400000 baud UART signals. As you maybe know, for the Taranis QX7(S) you can do the Crossfire inverter mod or select a lower baud rate in the Hardware menu (Page 6/7) of OpenTX to fix the issue. Can it be fixed? \u00b6 Well, the final verdict is not out yet, but the following may help to resolve the issue: Do a hardware mod as well on your X9D(+) as you can read all about here in PR# 59 for EdgeTX. This requires changing the 10k resistor R82 to a 1k resistor. Download a OneBit_Status firmware using this OpenTX version , based on OpenTX 2.3.12 and enable ONEBIT Select 115200 baud using the above OpenTX version. (ExpressLRS will lock you out on 500Hz packet rate, but below that rate should be stable now.) The nice thing about the OpenTX build above is that it also adds two additional Sync lines to show the current OpenTX/UART behavior. This will show in your Model Setup (Page 2/11) where you select the external module type (where you selected CRSF to enable ELRS): The first Sync line shows something like L00002R04000u . L and R indicates the microseconds of Lag and Rate. The L is how much OpenTX is trying to compensate to nail the rate you selected. (The closer to 0 the better) The R is just the Packet Rate you selected using the ExpressLRS Lua script. The second Sync line shows something like G11 C00 F00 . This stand for G (good packets), C (CRC error), F (Framing error). The goal is to have zero errors here. (Don't forget to power your receiver so a link is established!)

CRC checking has now been updated to 14-bit. The following tests were performed using the new CRC-14 bit implementation with a polynomial of 0x372B, which gives a hamming distance of 6 in a 57-bit range. What this means is that it can detect up to 5 randomly flipped bits a message that is 57 bits long. Three stress tests have been performed on the 50-bit data with CRC-14. The tests create random data in 7 bytes (the first byte only has the lower 2 bits set) then perform random bit flipping based on three styles. Bear in mind that the CRC is not in the data and so is not subject to bit flipping.

This is an explanation of the signal metrics provided by ExpressLRS and how to understand their values. Two Types of Signal Health \u00b6 There are two main types of signal information available from ExpressLRS: RSSI and LQI RSSI - Received Signal Strength Indicator, this value indicates how loud \ud83c\udfba the reception is. RSSI must be above the sensitivity level to be understood. Units are dBm and start from 0 and go down as the volume gets lower (-130dBm hard limit). LQI - Link Quality Indicator, this value indicates how much of the conversation is being understood and ultimately all that matters. Units are percent, with 100% being every packet is received, and 0% means no packets are being received. Consider you're having a conversation in a quiet room. Your partner speaks loudly enough for you to hear, so the RSSI of their voice is above the sensitivity of your ears. You're going to understand the conversation because you're hearing every word. That's a 100% LQI-- you're receiving 100% of the words. Now imagine someone blows an air horn right in the middle of a sentence. The RSSI is still the same level, you still hear what you could make out at the same volume, you missed a word so the LQI is lower. The closer the volume of the conversation is to the background noise level in the room, the greater the chance is that you'll miss a word due to it getting mixed in with the background noise and lowering your LQI. Remember, LQI is all that matters. Your partner could shout as loud as they want but if you could hear every word anyway, the volume doesn't matter, you always heard every word. Which do I care about? \u00b6 Both really. LQI is most important because you can't fly if you're not getting packets. RSSI is important because it tells you how close you are to the radio receiver not being able to receive packets at all. I'd say if you have just one, pick LQI, because that tells you what percentage of packets are getting through and you get to make the decision if it isn't enough. What you can't tell from LQI alone is when that number is going to drop off a cliff, and it could happen extremely fast because you hit the RSSI sensitivity limit. RSSI Sensitivity Limit \u00b6 This is the lowest theoretical RSSI value that can be distinguished by the radio receiver. It is displayed in the ELRS.lua when you select the packet rate, because different packet rates and frequency bands have different sensitivity limits. Lower rates are more sensitive, -123dBm for 25Hz 915MHz up to -105dBm for 500Hz 2400MHz. This gives you the limit you know you can't fly below. RSSI Channel \u00b6 RSSI and LQI are included already in the protocol used to communicate to the flight controller, so the \"RSSI Channel\" on the Receiver tab should be set to Disabled. RSSI_ADC / \"Analog RSSI input\" on the Configuration tab should also be disabled. Available RSSI OSD Fields \u00b6 RSSI dBm - This is the true RSSI value we've talked about here, and is available on Betaflight after 4.1 (?) and iNav after 2.6 (?) Link Quality - This is LQI discussed here, and has the same version requirements. Betaflight and iNav (LQ TYPE2 option) display add the RF Mode to this as well, e.g. 7:100 means mode 7 = 500Hz and 100% LQI. RSSI Value - Or sometimes just RSSI . This is the old undefined units of Signal Strength value that everyone is used to with no idea what value is good or what value is too bad. What value you'll actually see here varies, even on ExpressLRS, and is covered in the RSSI Value OSD field section. It is not recommended to use this field unless you have to (e.g. DJI). RSSI Value OSD field \u00b6 What appears in the RSSI Value field is based on what is selected as the RSSI Channel as ExpressLRS also sends LQI and RSSI as channels (AUX11/ch15 and AUX12/ch16 respectively). It is better to use the dBm or LQ OSD fields instead of this one if you can. DJI users are forced to use this due to it being the only field supported by their OSD. Changes to RSSI Channel in Betaflight requires a reboot to take effect. Disabled is set as the \"RSSI Channel\" field in Betaflight - Displays RSSI dBm scaled as a percentage from -130dBm to 0dBm. Not recommended since what percentage of 130 is the Sensitivity Limit for your selected rate? Math! AUX11/ch15 is set as the \"RSSI Channel\" - Simply LQI although the value might be slightly off due to rounding. AUX12/ch16 is set as the \"RSSI Channel\" - Displays the RSSI dBm scaled as a percentage from the current Sensitivity Limit to -50dBm and is a decent indicator of how much range is left before the LQI cliff (0 here = Sensitivity Limit). In iNAV, the RSSI Value on the OSD is called RSSI (Signal Strength), and will always display 0. To show a filtered (by iNav) LQI in that field, set the rssi_source to protocol using the CLI with set rssi_source = PROTOCOL . What about SNR? \u00b6 Wow look at you smarty pants! SNR stands for Signal to Noise ratio and compares RSSI dBm to the RF background noise level and is in dB units (not dBm). Notice it compares the background noise level and not the Sensitivity Limit. The value is of limited usefulness because the RF chip can only approximate the noise level and can only register a value so high above it leading to this value getting clipped. Add to that, LoRa modulation can actually receive data below the noise floor to some degree, so just ignore this number really, but positive values are better. How far can I go on XmW? \u00b6 Very far? This question is usually used in place of the actual question \"Will I get good signal where I fly?\" which is impossible to answer. ExpressLRS 2.4GHz can go over 40km at 250Hz 100mW on omnidirectional antennas with excellent LQI, or it can go 400m with less stellar LQI. By far the biggest factor in determining maximum range is direct line of sight. Blocking line of sight reduces RSSI dBm. A few trees or a building isn't going to keep you from flying due to ExpressLRS's excellent sensitivity even when line of sight isn't available, but range is reduced a bit for every physical object between you and the receiver. Piloting from an elevated position can eliminate some ground obstacles and provide a measurable boost in range. The second largest factor is interference. Interference is the clobbering of our packets by outside sources, such as wifi on 2.4GHz or other ISM transmissions on 868/915MHz, and is seen as a drop in LQI well before the sensitivity limit. Increasing TX power output is usually not the solution you'd expect, where each doubling in output power only might only add 10% to the usable range due to interference. #Team868/#Team915 or #Team2.4 \u00b6 Unfortunately, there is a misconception about the 2.4GHz range thanks to other radio protocols on the market. ExpressLRS uses LoRa, which has had some amazing results on 2.4GHz. Again, 40km on 100mW 250Hz on 2.4GHz. The advantages of 2.4GHz is that the antennas are 2.5x smaller than 915MHz antennas, and there's more spectrum for ExpressLRS to hop around in, opening up the air for more pilots at once. 868/915MHz does have increased penetration and is the ultimate king of long range flying, but penetration difference may not be as great as you think. The high sensitivity of ExpressLRS receivers allows them to fly places you wouldn't dream of flying FSK-based 2.4 receivers such as FrSky ACCST/ACCESS, FlySky AFHDS2A, Spektrum DMX, or Redpine. RF noise \u00b6 We have all heard the stories of racers powering up his TBS crossfire full module at 2W and causing people to fail-safe during a race. This happens because the 868/915mhz band has limited bandwidth. The solution for this is to use a low power mode during races, so you do not blast anyone out of the sky. 2.4ghz does not have this issue. Flite Test has a world record of having 179 RC airplanes in the sky using 2.4 GHz. 2.4GHz LoRa can also handle WiFi noise very well. Studies have been conducted with the coexistence of WiFi and LoRa bands. 868/915 does not have to worry about WiFi signal but it does have to worry about cell towers and other RF noise. You are fighting against thermostats, fire systems, burglar systems and any other device running on that band.","title":"Signal Health"},{"location":"info/signal-health/#two-types-of-signal-health","text":"There are two main types of signal information available from ExpressLRS: RSSI and LQI RSSI - Received Signal Strength Indicator, this value indicates how loud \ud83c\udfba the reception is.

Studies have been conducted with the coexistence of WiFi and LoRa bands. 868/915 does not have to worry about WiFi signal but it does have to worry about cell towers and other RF noise. You are fighting against thermostats, fire systems, burglar systems and any other device running on that band.","title":"RF noise"},{"location":"info/telem-bandwidth/","text":"Telemetry Burst describes the allocation of telemetry packets in ExpressLRS added in #472 . There are two types of packets, LINK and DATA. LINK is the standard link statistics and is always available, and DATA is \"Advanced Telemetry\" which is telemetry coming from the flight controller and shares bandwidth with MSP transfers. Burst mode attempts to maintain a minimum rate of LINK packets and use the rest of the available telemetry slots for DATA. The LINK rate chosen was one every 512ms, roughly 2 per second but slightly higher to allow more rates to have an additional burst packet at lower ratios.

It helps guide you through which options you should enable for your purposes or which options should be left at default. Some of these options are present on both the Tx and Rx Targets. It is important that these options match to both the TX module and receiver in order for them to bind. team2400 and team900 also share a few options and some options are unique to that frequency band. Shown below are common options available on team2400 and team900 TXes respectively. Regulatory Domains \u00b6 Regulatory_Domain_AU_915 Regulatory_Domain_EU_868 Regulatory_Domain_FCC_915 Regulatory_Domain_ISM_2400 This is a relatively simple one - enable whatever regulatory domain you are in. EU 868 is compliant to the frequency but is not LBT compliant \ud83d\udc42 . Every other band is near compliant \ud83d\udc7f but may not be fully compliant for your regulatory domain. Binding Phrase \u00b6 This step is simple but important . Both the TX and RX NEED to have the same binding phrase or ExpressLRS WILL NOT WORK . Anyone using the same binding phrase as you will be able to control your model, so be unique. Set something memorable, and limit to alphanumeric phrases conforming to the Latin alphabet. Receivers flashed with firmware builds that do not have binding phrase enabled will support and require the traditional binding method . \ud83d\udcdc Performance Options \u00b6 NO_SYNC_ON_ARM no sync on arm doesn't transmit sync packets while armed. This is useful for racing as there is less time & packets wasted \ud83d\uddd1\ufe0f on sending sync packets. HOWEVER if you are doing serious long range \u26f0\ufe0f, keep this commented because in the case of a sustained failsafe, link can not be regained while armed. AUX1 is the channel ExpressLRS uses to detect \"ARMED\", and this feature assumes that a low value of the arm switch is disarmed, and a high value is armed . OpenTX can invert your switch if you prefer it to be mechanically inverted. It may be best not to enable no sync on arm when you are first setting up ExpressLRS as it can be a source of confusion. FEATURE_OPENTX_SYNC This option enables lower latency \ud83c\udfc3\u200d\u2642\ufe0f from the OpenTX radio to the TX and should be kept enabled. To get the full benefit of the option, you should be running an OpenTX version with CRSFShot or Mixer Sync enabled. USE-500HZ This enables 500Hz mode for 2.4 GHz RXes and TXes. The drawback is that you have to give up 25Hz mode to add 500Hz mode. It requires OpenTX 2.3.12 or Newer , EdgeTX or a Radio firmware that has CRSFShot or Mixer Sync. Note: Since version 1.0.0-RC9, this option is now always enabled and in turn, 25Hz has been dropped/removed. Extra Data \u00b6 HYBRID_SWITCHES_8 Changes how the AUX channels are sent over the air. The default option is Normal Mode with 8x 2-position low-latency switches. Enabling HYBRID_SWITCHES_8 changes this to 1x 2-pos + 6x 7-pos + 1x 16-pos, with only the 2-position being low-latency. In Normal Mode, all switches are sent with every packet; while in Hybrid Mode, only AUX1 is sent with every packet and the rest are rotated through. Note: The switch mode MUST match between the TX and RX . A detailed explanation of the differences between the two options can be found in the Switch Modes page. ENABLE_TELEMETRY Enable advanced telemetry support. This option must be enabled on both TX and RX . The following telemetry messages are supported: GPS BATTERY_SENSOR ATTITUDE DEVICE_INFO FLIGHT_MODE MSP_RESP Note 1 : Increase the telemetry rate with the ExpressLRS lua script. Increase the rate until the sensor lost warnings go away. It is normal to set it up to 1:16 with a 200 Hz refresh rate. Note 2 : It must be enabled together with HYBRID_SWITCHES_8 . With this unchecked/disabled, you will only get the basic RC Link Telemetry like 1RRS (RSSI dbm), RQLY (LQ) etc. Tip. You can have this option enabled in the Firmware Configuration, but set TLM Ratio to OFF in the ELRS Lua Script when you don't need advanced telemetry (like when racing). Should you need the telemetry (freestyle or medium-to-long-range flying), flip TLM Ratio back to your favorite ratio, like 1:16 or 1:8. TLM_REPORT_INTERVAL_MS It makes the TX module send the telemetry data to OpenTX to the interval you set. This stops the telemetry lost warnings when running a high telemetry ratio, or low rates like 50hz. Default value is 320LU . If you want to change that you have to suffix your milliseconds value with LU . For example, in order to specify 100 ms telemetry update rate you have to enter it like this: 100LU . Typically, you want to keep 320LU value for OpenTX based radios, and 100LU for ErskyTx ones. Tip: only check this if you're changing the value. No need to enable it if you'll be using the default 320LU value Other Options \u00b6 JUST_BEEP_ONCE DISABLE_STARTUP_BEEP MY_STARTUP_MELODY=\"<music string>|<bpm>|<semitone offset>\" For TXes like the R9M, this sets if the TX only beeps one-time, not beep at all or play custom a startup song. By default it is set to play the ExpressLRS Startup Tune \ud83c\udfbc , but if you don't prefer it, or simply want to go stealthy, enable any of these options. \u2716\ufe0f For all your customization needs, use MY_STARTUP_MELODY to define your own startup melody using either the BlHeli32 syntax or RTTL. The BlHeli32 Synatax has the required parameters music string and bpm , and semitone offset is optional to transpose the entire melody up or down by the defined amount of semitones. Example BlHeli32 melodies are available on Rox Wolfs youtube channel , some experimentation may be required though. To write your own melody, this (Sheet Music 101) and this (BLHeli Piano) are useful resources. The RTTL Syntax is the same as used in old mobil phones for ringtones and some examples of it can be found here , where you can search through many existing RTTL melodies. UNLOCK_HIGHER_POWER Majority of the ExpressLRS modules maxes out at 250mW. With this option, higher power levels can be unlocked on the modules that supports it. However, it is imperative that you have taken measures to provide ample cooling to the module's internals through the use of a Fan Mod . This specifically applies to the R9M, which, from factory, supports a higher power level up to 1W; but because ExpressLRS runs at a much higher duty cycle, it taxes the circuity and thus produces heat much earlier. To keep it stable, cooling should be implemented. Without any cooling, you run the risk of ending up with a red paperweight. UART_INVERTED This only works with ESP based TXes (will not work with modules without built-in inversion/uninversion), but enables compatibility with radios that output inverted CRSF, such as the FrSky QX7, TBS Tango 2, RadioMaster TX16S. You want to keep this enabled in most of the cases. If your radio is T8SG V2 or you use Deviation firmware turn this setting off. Receiver Only Options \u00b6 Note: Configuration of the Receivers should match the configuration of the Transmitter Module for Sync/Binding to happen between devices. The explanation of the options for the Transmitter Modules also apply for the Receivers. But here's a few Receiver-specific Options you can configure: LOCK_ON_FIRST_CONNECTION RF Mode Locking - When the RX is waiting for a connection, it cycles through all available rates waiting for a connection on each one. By default, ExpressLRS will go back to this mode after a disconnect (failsafe). If LOCK_ON_FIRST_CONNECTION is used, ELRS will not cycle after a disconnect, but instead just stay on whatever rate the last connection was. This makes connection re-establishment quick, because the RX is always listening at the proper rate. This is generally what everyone wants, but there is utility in being able to switch the TX to the lowest rate to get more range to re-establish a link with a downed model, which can't happen if the RX is locked at the previous rate. When cycling through the rates, the RX starts with the fastest packet rate and works down to the slowest, then repeats. It waits PACKET_INTERVAL * PACKS_PER_HOP * HOP_COUNT * 1.1 at each rate. Example: 4ms * 4 * 80 * 1.1 = 1.408s for 250Hz. The duration is extended 10x if a valid packet is received during that time. Even with LOCK_ON_FIRST_CONNECTION, the rate can be changed by changing the TX rate using ELRS.lua while connected, or by power cycling the RX. AUTO_WIFI_ON_INTERVAL \u26a0\ufe0f Must be defined if you plan to update your RX over wifi without using a button on the RX \u26a0\ufe0f This will automatically turn the wifi \ud83d\udcf6 on for any module that has an ESP8285 on it if no TX connection is established after N seconds from boot (Factory Firmware of the HappyModel receivers set this to the previous default of 20s. RC8 has increased the interval to 30s). This enables pushing firmware updates to the RX by connecting to its wifi network and visiting http://10.0.0.1 . USE_DIVERSITY Enable antenna-switching diversity for Receivers that support it. USE_R9MM_R9MINI_SBUS This does not turn on SBUS protocol it simply changes the pin used for communication from those two side pins (A9 and A10) to use the pin labeled \"SBUS\" on the RX, which is inverted. This is useful for F4 FCs which only have an inverted receiver input UART RX. \ud83d\udd3c. This is only one way, so you lose the telemetry downlink to your radio as well as passthrough flashing. Enabling this turns on CRSF protocol output on the S.BUS \ud83d\ude8c pin on your R9MM/R9Mini. set serialrx_inverted = ON may also be needed within Betaflight \ud83d\udc1d for compatibility For a complete list of User Defines, head over to the User Defines page .

The following telemetry messages are supported: GPS BATTERY_SENSOR ATTITUDE DEVICE_INFO FLIGHT_MODE MSP_RESP Note 1 : Increase the telemetry rate with the ExpressLRS lua script. Increase the rate until the sensor lost warnings go away. It is normal to set it up to 1:16 with a 200 Hz refresh rate. Note 2 : It must be enabled together with HYBRID_SWITCHES_8 . With this unchecked/disabled, you will only get the basic RC Link Telemetry like 1RRS (RSSI dbm), RQLY (LQ) etc. Tip. You can have this option enabled in the Firmware Configuration, but set TLM Ratio to OFF in the ELRS Lua Script when you don't need advanced telemetry (like when racing). Should you need the telemetry (freestyle or medium-to-long-range flying), flip TLM Ratio back to your favorite ratio, like 1:16 or 1:8. TLM_REPORT_INTERVAL_MS It makes the TX module send the telemetry data to OpenTX to the interval you set. This stops the telemetry lost warnings when running a high telemetry ratio, or low rates like 50hz. Default value is 320LU . If you want to change that you have to suffix your milliseconds value with LU . For example, in order to specify 100 ms telemetry update rate you have to enter it like this: 100LU . Typically, you want to keep 320LU value for OpenTX based radios, and 100LU for ErskyTx ones. Tip: only check this if you're changing the value. No need to enable it if you'll be using the default 320LU value","title":"Extra Data"},{"location":"quick-start/firmware-options/#other-options","text":"JUST_BEEP_ONCE DISABLE_STARTUP_BEEP MY_STARTUP_MELODY=\"<music string>|<bpm>|<semitone offset>\" For TXes like the R9M, this sets if the TX only beeps one-time, not beep at all or play custom a startup song. By default it is set to play the ExpressLRS Startup Tune \ud83c\udfbc , but if you don't prefer it, or simply want to go stealthy, enable any of these options. \u2716\ufe0f For all your customization needs, use MY_STARTUP_MELODY to define your own startup melody using either the BlHeli32 syntax or RTTL. The BlHeli32 Synatax has the required parameters music string and bpm , and semitone offset is optional to transpose the entire melody up or down by the defined amount of semitones. Example BlHeli32 melodies are available on Rox Wolfs youtube channel , some experimentation may be required though. To write your own melody, this (Sheet Music 101) and this (BLHeli Piano) are useful resources. The RTTL Syntax is the same as used in old mobil phones for ringtones and some examples of it can be found here , where you can search through many existing RTTL melodies. UNLOCK_HIGHER_POWER Majority of the ExpressLRS modules maxes out at 250mW. With this option, higher power levels can be unlocked on the modules that supports it. However, it is imperative that you have taken measures to provide ample cooling to the module's internals through the use of a Fan Mod . This specifically applies to the R9M, which, from factory, supports a higher power level up to 1W; but because ExpressLRS runs at a much higher duty cycle, it taxes the circuity and thus produces heat much earlier. To keep it stable, cooling should be implemented. Without any cooling, you run the risk of ending up with a red paperweight. UART_INVERTED This only works with ESP based TXes (will not work with modules without built-in inversion/uninversion), but enables compatibility with radios that output inverted CRSF, such as the FrSky QX7, TBS Tango 2, RadioMaster TX16S. You want to keep this enabled in most of the cases. If your radio is T8SG V2 or you use Deviation firmware turn this setting off.","title":"Other Options"},{"location":"quick-start/firmware-options/#receiver-only-options","text":"Note: Configuration of the Receivers should match the configuration of the Transmitter Module for Sync/Binding to happen between devices. The explanation of the options for the Transmitter Modules also apply for the Receivers. But here's a few Receiver-specific Options you can configure: LOCK_ON_FIRST_CONNECTION RF Mode Locking - When the RX is waiting for a connection, it cycles through all available rates waiting for a connection on each one. By default, ExpressLRS will go back to this mode after a disconnect (failsafe). If LOCK_ON_FIRST_CONNECTION is used, ELRS will not cycle after a disconnect, but instead just stay on whatever rate the last connection was. This makes connection re-establishment quick, because the RX is always listening at the proper rate. This is generally what everyone wants, but there is utility in being able to switch the TX to the lowest rate to get more range to re-establish a link with a downed model, which can't happen if the RX is locked at the previous rate. When cycling through the rates, the RX starts with the fastest packet rate and works down to the slowest, then repeats. It waits PACKET_INTERVAL * PACKS_PER_HOP * HOP_COUNT * 1.1 at each rate. Example: 4ms * 4 * 80 * 1.1 = 1.408s for 250Hz. The duration is extended 10x if a valid packet is received during that time. Even with LOCK_ON_FIRST_CONNECTION, the rate can be changed by changing the TX rate using ELRS.lua while connected, or by power cycling the RX. AUTO_WIFI_ON_INTERVAL \u26a0\ufe0f Must be defined if you plan to update your RX over wifi without using a button on the RX \u26a0\ufe0f This will automatically turn the wifi \ud83d\udcf6 on for any module that has an ESP8285 on it if no TX connection is established after N seconds from boot (Factory Firmware of the HappyModel receivers set this to the previous default of 20s. RC8 has increased the interval to 30s). This enables pushing firmware updates to the RX by connecting to its wifi network and visiting http://10.0.0.1 . USE_DIVERSITY Enable antenna-switching diversity for Receivers that support it. USE_R9MM_R9MINI_SBUS This does not turn on SBUS protocol it simply changes the pin used for communication from those two side pins (A9 and A10) to use the pin labeled \"SBUS\" on the RX, which is inverted. This is useful for F4 FCs which only have an inverted receiver input UART RX. \ud83d\udd3c. This is only one way, so you lose the telemetry downlink to your radio as well as passthrough flashing. Enabling this turns on CRSF protocol output on the S.BUS \ud83d\ude8c pin on your R9MM/R9Mini. set serialrx_inverted = ON may also be needed within Betaflight \ud83d\udc1d for compatibility For a complete list of User Defines, head over to the User Defines page .

Modes \u00b6 By default, ExpressLRS uses one-bit switches for the AUX channels. This means a three-position switch will only send two positions (fully off, or 1000, and fully on, or 2000) to Betaflight/iNav on the AUX channels. Set your modes appropriately if you are using one-bit switches, or enable HYBRID_SWITCHES_8 for expanded position options. For more information, read the switch modes page . RSSI and Link Quality \u00b6 To get RSSI and Link Quality displayed in the OSD, set RSSI Channel to \"Disabled\" in the Receiver tab of the Betaflight/iNav Configurator, and RSSI_ADC should be disabled on the Configuration tab. Both of these are the default. On the OSD menu, use the Link Quality and RSSI dBm value elements (not \"RSSI Value\"). iNav have put this in the CRSF RX Statistics section. If you wish to enable the rssi dBm warning, you'll have to change the alarm level using set osd_rssi_dbm_alarm = -100 in CLI. A sensible value is 5-10 higher than the sensitivity shown in the ELRS.lua for the packet rate (e.g. 250Hz=-108, so -103 to -98 for the alarm). If using DJI Goggles, you're required to use \"RSSI Value\" as the OSD element. Therefore you have to decide between LQ or RSSI, by selecting either AUX11 (LQ) or AUX12 (RSSI) as RSSI Channel on the Receiver tab. More information about signal metrics is found in this great article on signal health . Bench Test \u00b6 Shown above is a Bench Test to determine if you're getting a good signal from your radio. This aims to provide you information on whether you should check your antennas (particularly the R9's Super 8) or you have good hardware overall. Set your ExpressLRS module to just 10mW using the Lua script. The packet rate doesn't matter much here. Put your radio 1m (3ft) from your receiver and power it up. Make sure the receiver and TX module antennas are oriented in the same way. (You might want to disconnect your vtx/air unit temporarily, put vtx on pit mode or have a fan blowing on it). Using your OSD or the Telemetry Page of your radio, take note of the RSSI dbm or the 1RSS telemetry data. On the 900Mhz hardware, a -20dbm or thereabouts is a good indication your hardware is in working order. On the 2.4Ghz hardware, around -40dbm to -30dbm should be good. If you're getting lower numbers than these, here are a few things you could check: The ExpressLRS module antenna could be loose. On some 3D printed module cases, the print may be too thick at the part where the pigtail's RP-SMA/SMA end would be attached; if so, tighten the nut on the RP-SMA/SMA to give the antenna some more space to get tightened up. The antenna pigtail may be damaged or not connected properly to the module's mainboard. On receivers using an SMD antennas, expect lower values than those equipped with wire antennas. If the receiver with the SMD antenna has heat shrink, enclosed in a whoop canopy, surrounded with carbon parts or buried inside a plane/fixed wing, expect some more attenuation of the signal. The Super 8 antenna from Frsky, which most of the R9Ms came with, are notorious for being faulty or would degrade from just a few weeks use. Replace it or as a temporary fix, solder all around the junction where the coax shielding and the RP-SMA meet. Check if there aren't any missing components in your receivers, like the RF filter (can be found near the antenna or ufl). Also check if the SMD antenna is not broken or damaged and it's soldered in properly. Some DIY modules require moving the 0 ohm resistor on the E28 from the PCB antenna side towards the UFL side. A solder bridge will work just fine as well, but make sure it is on the correct pads. Super8 Antenna's common point of failure Blackbox \u00b6 Blackbox is handy for evaluating the performance of the RF link for a flight. Set your BB to debug mode RC_SMOOTHING_RATE , which will capture the rate that Betaflight is receiving RC Packets from the RX. Telemetry \u00b6 Initially ExpressLRS had very limited telemetry support but with Version 1.0.0-RC1 this changed and full telemetry was added as optional feature . The default setting only includes the link status message that includes the RSSI and Link quality. To receive all messages the feature telemetry has to be enabled in the user defines . It's possible to flash your TX module with telemetry support enabled and use it with a RX without telemetry enabled . So you can flash certain receivers with telemetry support and others without it and use it with the same TX module. The RX transmits a subset of telemetry it receives from the flight controller. Disabling certain messages only works if the flight controller firmware does support it. For Betaflight this is possible with the telemetry_disabled_* cli settings: # Disable Attitude telemetry item set telemetry_disabled_pitch = ON set telemetry_disabled_roll = ON set telemetry_disabled_heading = ON # Disable Battery telemetry item set telemetry_disabled_voltage = ON set telemetry_disabled_current = ON set telemetry_disabled_fuel = ON # Disable GPS telemetry item set telemetry_disabled_altitude = ON set telemetry_disabled_lat_long = ON set telemetry_disabled_ground_speed = ON set telemetry_disabled_heading = ON # Disable Flight Mode telemetry item (BF >4.2.9) set telemetry_disabled_mode = ON Since telemetry messages are sent with low priority it takes some time to transmit the data. The telemetry rate in the lua settings script controls how often a telemetry message should be sent. So a ratio of 1:2 means that every second message is a telemetry message, so the telemetry data is transferred very fast. A ratio 1:64 means that only one of 64 messages is a telemetry message and so the transfer happens much slower. The refresh rate also impacts the transfer speed. 50 Hz is slower compared to 200 Hz. So if you need fast a fast telemetry update rate choose high refresh rate, and a ratio that favors telemetry messages e.g. 200 Hz and 1:16 usually works good. For detailed information on telemetry bandwidth at different rates and ratios, see this page on telemetry bandwidth . To finish the telemetry setup open the telemetry page on your transmitter and select \"Discover new sensors\" and wait for the list to fill. You will notice that there is a * sign for each row. This star indicates that this telemetry sensor was just updated. If you see a row that does not change, and the name of the row is in square brackets it means that this sensor was not updated for some time. The first values (including RSSI and link quality) should always be updated (flashing stars). If this does not happen multiple times per second the transmitter will issue a \"telemetry warning\". To prevent this warning use the setting TLM_REPORT_INTERVAL_MS. It should look like this (and if it does not there is something wrong with your setup): The remaining values are updated at a different rate (depending on refresh rate and tlm ratio). So if you use 50 Hz and 1:64 it will happen really slow, and the update takes multiple seconds for each sensor: If you use 200Hz and 1:2 tlm ratio the stars will not even blink because the update happens so fast: MSP \u00b6 To configure betaflight from your transmitter it's possible to use the betaflight lua scripts. This requires the telemetry feature enabled for the RX+TX. If the telemetry page of OpenTx does not show regular updates for all sensors the LUA script will also not work. Mavlink is not supported and currently not planned to be added. To get a responsive UI configure ExpressLRS for fast data transfer so make sure to use something like 200Hz/500Hz with 1:2 tlm and a serial baud rate of 400000 . Currently MSP is limited to 50Hz on 115200 Baud and does not work with 500 Hz refresh rate. The initial VTX tables download does take long - but is cached after that. If you get a \"retrying\" message while saving changes it means that the lua script did not receive a response fast enough. But the change usually still goes through so try reloading the page to check if the change was saved. With the recommended settings this does not happen but with slower settings it could happen.

Forget the factory wiring guide! After you've flashed the bootloader and wired your receiver as above, proceed to configure up your flight controller as shown below . Note: R9 Slim requires flashing via STLink first. Passthrough should work for updates. Happymodel EP1, EP2, PP \u00b6 Labels show the receiver pinouts and not to which pads to connect them (in case of the RX and Tx pads). As we're dealing with UART connection, Rx on receiver goes to a TX pad in the FC, and Tx on Receiver goes to an uninverted Rx pad on the FC. There are certain FCs that puts their Receiver UART's RX pads Low, which in turn, puts the EP-based (e.g. EP1 and EP2) receivers to Bootloader mode unintentionally. One remedy is to wire them into a different UART, or wire a pull-up resistor (300-1k ohm) into the RX pad (FC Rx pad -> Resistor -> 3v3 pad). Also of note is that the EP receivers require their Boot pads (see figure above) be bridged on first time Passthrough Flash from their factory firmwares. After the first passthrough flashing, the bridge needs to be removed, and is no longer needed for subsequent passthrough flashing. Flashing via Wifi doesn't need the Boot Pads bridged. Moreover, if it is bridged, the receiver will stay in bootloader mode and won't activate the wifi hotspot. Connect your FC to USB and configure your FC firmware as below .

Additionally, the Boot Pads, encircled in the photo above, needs to be bridged in the first-time passthrough flash from the factory firmware. As this is an ESP-based receiver, be aware that there are certain FCs that puts their Receiver UART's RX pads Low, which in turn, puts the receiver to Bootloader mode unintentionally. One remedy is to wire them into a different UART, or wire a pull-up resistor (300-1k ohm) into the RX pad (FC Rx pad -> Resistor -> 3v3 pad).

Connect your FC to USB and configure your FC firmware as shown below . Serial RX Setup \u00b6 Once wired up to our Flight Controller, we need to setup the UART for Serial RX. In the example below, the Receiver is wired to a Tx1/Rx1 (UART1) Pad, and so the Serial RX column should be activated on UART1. Protocol \u00b6 Similar to your OpenTX Radio, we are using the CRSF protocol between the receiver and the FC firmware (Betaflight/iNav/emuflight), so on the \"Configuration\" tab, you need to select \"Serial-based receiver\" on the \"Receiver\" panel, and select \"CRSF\" as the protocol. Telemetry is optional here and will reduce your stick update rate due to those transmit slots being used for telemetry. Inversion (Software & Hardware) and Duplex Modes \u00b6 The CRSF Protocol requires a full UART pair, uninverted and in full-duplex mode. Using the CLI, check if serialrx_inverted is OFF and serialrx_halfduplex is OFF . To do this, simply type get serialrx in the CLI to see the settings for both at the same time. You can use set serialrx_inverted=off or set serialrx_halfduplex=off to turn them off respectively. Don't forget to also type in save after the change. You can't use an RX pad that is shared to an SBUS pad, unless you remove the inversion or reroute the line (by bridging pads in the FC although not all FC have this). The easiest way to determine which UART can be used with ExpressLRS is to check which UART the manufacturer suggests you wire a Crossfire/Ghost receiver to.

Starting with OpenTX-2.3.12 , CRSFshot has been fully implemented, and thus you will have to update your OpenTX radio to these newer versions. Another alternative is EdgeTX , the bleeding edge fork of OpenTX. These firmwares allow flashing of .elrs files too. CRSF Protocol \u00b6 ExpressLRS uses the CRSF serial protocol to communicate between the transmitter and the TX module. To set this up, enter into your model settings, and on the \"Model Setup\" tab, enable your \"External RF\" and select \"CRSF\" as the protocol: NOTE: Make sure the internal module is turned off. NOTE: Make sure the internal module is turned off. Serial Baud Rate \u00b6 On some transmitters, the baud rate for comms between the opentx and the ExpressLRS module can be changed. The two rates available are 115200 and 400000. ExpressLRS supports both rates (auto switches to the correct rate on power-up), however, we have found that on the R9M 2018 modules, the inverter IC's that are used are not capable of reliably handling 400k baud. If you're using an R9M 2018 module, select 115200 baud in OpenTX, or do the resistor mod described on the R9M 2018 Resistor Mod page. The QX7, X10/S, X12 will also going to require the Crossfire Mod if you're going to use 400k baud rates for use with higher packet rates, particularly with the 2.4G ExpressLRS Modules. Alternatively, EdgeTX can be flashed into these Radios and have OneBit enabled. The X9D(plus) can't change its Max Bauds settings, but it has been found to be finicky, causing unstable packet transfers, and constant Telemetry Lost/Recovered messages from OpenTX. One fix for this is the use of the OneBit firmware or EdgeTX. Click here for more info. ADC Filter \u00b6 The ADC filter is enabled by default in OpenTX and is known to cause issues with RC Command data. This can result in \"jagged\" RC command responses in black box logs, caused by sequential RC packets that have the same command value (which were \"smoothed\" by the ADC filter). We recommend turning the ADC filter OFF in OpenTX . Lua Script \u00b6 For faster access to the Lua script, save the ELRS.lua File from this link: ExLRS Lua Script onto the radio's SD Card in the Scripts/Tools folder and Long Press the \"SYS\" button (for T16 or similar Radios) or the \"Menu\" button (for Taranis X9D or similar Radios) to access the Tools Menu where you can find ELRS script ready to run with only one click. Another way to get the ELRS Lua Script is via the ExpressLRS Configurator. Here's how it looks in the Tools Menu: Note: For devices not yet flashed with ExpressLRS, the section below will not work. The Lua script has an important feature that's highly valuable with troubleshooting. On the first line, after the 6-character version hash, it shows an indicator 0:nnn which tells you how many bad UART packets and how many good UART packets per second it's getting from the radio. It can be used to confirm the communication between the Radio and the TX module is working properly. e.g. if you have set the Packet Rate to 200Hz, 0:200 means 0 bad packets and 200 good packets. The second number should match the selected packet rate (200 for 200Hz, 500 for 500Hz, etc..) If it doesn't and is stuck at 250 that means CRSFshot isn't working. Go back to the top of this page and verify you've done all the steps above correctly.

The latter could mean that the module's PCB has gotten loose, common with the first batches of the ES24TX modules from Happymodel. If the number up top the lua script is showing 0:142, etc., have a look at your model settings and make sure the internal RF module is set to off. The \"33e2a6\" from the photo above is the Commit Hash of the firmware version that the module has. You can reference this hash from Releases .

The default choice is to have 8x 2-position switches. \ud83e\udd48 That's really about all there is to this mode, other than noting that you should have your arm switch on AUX1.

In HYBRID_SWITCHES_8 mode, AUX1 is sent with every packet going out, this is the most reliable way to be able to tell your model to disarm. If your arm switch is in another aux channel, it may be several packets before that switch is transmitted, and there's no guarantee that the RX will actually receive that packet. There's a non-trivial chance your model may not ever disarm if the link quality is low and it just so happens that the packet containing the arm switch is getting missed every time. Forcing the arm switch into every packet on AUX1 means that if any packet is received by ExpresLRS, it will disarm your model, not just a less than 1-in-7 chance. It also protects against unintentional disarms caused by a corrupt packet changing the value of the arm switch to disarmed. Betaflight requires that 4x \"disarm\" commands are received before disarming to guard against this possibility. With arm on AUX1, a single corrupt packet can not disarm your model. With arm on AUX2-8, the one corrupt switch value will be sent 6 times before the value is refreshed, but the flight controller would have already disarmed by that point. I use a 3-pos switch for arm, this software is unusable \u00b6 You can still use a 3-position switch to arm! AUX1 just needs to be 2-position, not the physical switch. Simply adjust the mixer in your transmitter so AUX1 works like an on-off switch. If your 3-position arm switch had a second function as well, such as enabling Blackbox, just use one of the other 7 AUX channels to send the switch on a second channel. Why can't I have switches / potentiometers with full 10-bit resolution? \u00b6 A lot of the magic of ExpressLRS comes from its small packet sizes, there simply is not enough space to put all that data. There are tricks that can be done with interleaving sticks and switches packets but we believe sticks should be in every packet for the lowest control latency.

We recommend reading this page in its entirety before first flashing \u26a1 to have a better sense of the options. Binding Phrase \u00b6 -DMY_BINDING_PHRASE=\"default ExpressLRS binding phrase\" This step is simple but important . Both the TX and RX NEED to have the same binding phrase or ExpressLRS WILL NOT WORK . Anyone using the same binding phrase as you will be able to control your model, so be unique. Set something memorable, and limit to alphanumeric phrases conforming to the Latin alphabet * . Receivers flashed with firmware builds that do not have binding phrase enabled will support and require the traditional binding method. \ud83d\udcdc * This phrase gets md5 hashed and gets built into the binary you will be flashing.

EU 868 \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddfa is compliant to the frequency but is not LBT compliant \ud83d\udc42 . Every other band is near compliant \ud83d\udc7f but may not be fully compliant for your regulatory domain. Telemetry \u00b6 #-DENABLE_TELEMETRY Enable advanced telemetry support. This option must be enabled on both TX and RX . The following telemetry messages are supported: GPS BATTERY_SENSOR ATTITUDE DEVICE_INFO FLIGHT_MODE MSP_RESP Note 1 : Increase the telemetry rate with the ExpressLRS lua script. Increase the rate until the sensor lost warnings go away. It is normal to set it up to 1:16 with 200 Hz refresh rate. Note 2 : It must be enabled together with HYBRID_SWITCHES_8 . #-DTLM_REPORT_INTERVAL_MS=320LU It makes the TX module send the telemetry data to the OpenTX every 320 ms by default. This stops the telemetry lost warnings when running a high telemetry ratio, or low rates like 50hz. Default value is 320LU . If you want to change that you have to suffix your milliseconds value with LU . For example, in order to specify 100 ms telemetry update rate you have to enter it like this: 100LU . Typically, you want to keep 320LU value for OpenTX based radios, and 100LU for ErskyTx ones. Switches \u00b6 #-DHYBRID_SWITCHES_8 Changes how the AUX channels are sent over the air. The default option is Normal Mode with 8x 2-position low-latency switches. Enabling HYBRID_SWITCHES_8 changes this to 1x 2-pos + 6x 7-pos + 1x 16-pos, with only the 2-position being low-latency. In Normal Mode, all switches are sent with every packet, in Hybrid Mode, only AUX1 is sent with every packet and the rest are rotated through. Note: The switch mode MUST match between the RX and TX. A detailed explanation of the differences between the two options can be found in Switch Modes , but 1. If only two position switches are needed, and they must be updated as fast as possible: Normal Mode 2. Almost everyone: Hybrid Mode (Put ARM on AUX1) Output Power Limit \u00b6 There has been some reports of the R9M modules showing instability at >250mw with stock cooling. This in part because the ELRS uses a higher duty cycle for transmission compared to stock firmware. By default the power of any TX is limited to 250mw but you can unlock up to 1000mw (for hardware that supports it) by enabling the following option. Do this at your own risk if you make no cooling modifications-- R9M modules will burn themselves out without cooling. #-DUNLOCK_HIGHER_POWER We published R9M Fan Mod Cover , a custom 3d printed backplate with room for a fan and extra cooling to allow for maximum power (1-2W depending on the mod). Performance Options \u00b6 #-DNO_SYNC_ON_ARM no sync on arm doesn't transmit sync packets while armed. This is useful for racing as there is less time & packets wasted \ud83d\uddd1\ufe0f on sending sync packets. HOWEVER if you are doing serious long range \u26f0\ufe0f, keep this commented because in the case of a sustained failsafe, link can not be regained while armed. AUX1 is the channel ExpressLRS uses to detect \"ARMED\", and this feature assumes that a low value of the arm switch is disarmed, and a high value is armed . OpenTX can invert your switch if you prefer it to be mechanically inverted. It may be best not to enable no sync on arm when you are first setting up ExpressLRS as it can be a source of confusion. -DFEATURE_OPENTX_SYNC #-DFEATURE_OPENTX_SYNC_AUTOTUNE These features enable lower latency \ud83c\udfc3\u200d\u2642\ufe0f and offset from the OpenTX radio to the TX. The first lowers latency and should be kept enabled. The second is more experimental and can lower the offset from the radio by tuning it as close as possible to 0 , but is experimental (even in 1.0) and is best left disabled. Both require OpenTX 2.3.12 or above. In order to install it, you will have to use OpenTX companion application. Deviation radio users such as those with the T8SGv2/v3 should disable this feature. You can also use EdgeTX . -DLOCK_ON_FIRST_CONNECTION RF Mode Locking - When the RX is waiting for a connection, it cycles through all available rates waiting for a connection on each one. By default, ExpressLRS will go back to this mode after a disconnect (failsafe). If LOCK_ON_FIRST_CONNECTION is used, ELRS will not cycle after a disconnect, but instead just stay on whatever rate the last connection was. This makes connection re-establishment quick, because the RX is always listening at the proper rate. This is generally what everyone wants, but there is utility in being able to switch the TX to the lowest rate to get more range to re-establish a link with a downed model, which can't happen if the RX is locked at the previous rate. When cycling through the rates, the RX starts with the fastest packet rate and works down to the slowest, then repeats. It waits PACKET_INTERVAL * PACKS_PER_HOP * HOP_COUNT * 1.1 at each rate. Example: 4ms * 4 * 80 * 1.1 = 1.408s for 250Hz. The duration is extended 10x if a valid packet is received during that time. Even with LOCK_ON_FIRST_CONNECTION , the rate can be changed by changing the TX rate using ELRS.lua while connected, or by power cycling the RX. #-DUSE_DIVERSITY Enable antenna-switching diversity for RX that support it. Compatability Options \u00b6 -DUART_INVERTED This only works with ESP32 based TXes (will not work with modules without built-in inversion/uninversion), but enables compatibility with radios that output inverted CRSF, such as the FrSky QX7, TBS Tango 2, RadioMaster TX16S. You want to keep this enabled in most of the cases. If your radio is T8SG V2 or you use Deviation firmware turn this setting off. -DUSE_UART2 This enables integration with Jye's FENIX rx5805 pro-diversity module \ud83d\udc77 #-DUSE_R9MM_R9MINI_SBUS This does not turn on SBUS protocol it simply changes the pin used for communication from those two side pins (A9 and A10) to use the pin labeled \"SBUS\" on the RX, which is inverted. This is useful for F4 FCs which only have an inverted receiver input UART RX. \ud83d\udd3c. This is only one way, so you lose the telemetry downlink to your radio as well as passthrough flashing. Enabling this turns on CRSF protocol output on the S.BUS \ud83d\ude8c pin on your R9MM/R9Mini . set serialrx_inverted = ON may also be needed within Betaflight \ud83d\udc1d for compatibility Other Options \u00b6 -DAUTO_WIFI_ON_INTERVAL=30 \u26a0\ufe0f Must be defined if you plan to update your RX over wifi without using a button on the RX \u26a0\ufe0f This will automatically turn the wifi \ud83d\udcf6 on for any module that has an ESP8285 on it if no TX connection is established after N seconds from boot (the 30 is the time). This enables pushing firmware updates to the RX by connecting to its wifi network and visiting http://10.0.0.1 . #-DJUST_BEEP_ONCE #-DMY_STARTUP_MELODY=\"<music string>|<bpm>|<semitone offset>\" -or- #-DMY_STARTUP_MELODY=\"<rtttl string>\" For TXes like the R9M, this sets if the TX only beeps one-time versus playing a startup song. Currently, it is set to play the startup song \ud83c\udfbc , but if you don't prefer it, uncomment this to turn it off. \u2716\ufe0f For all your customization needs, use DMY_STARTUP_MELODY to define your own startup melody using the BlHeli32 or RTTTL syntax. For BLHeli32, the parameters music string and bpm are required, whereas semitone offset is optional to transpose the entire melody up or down by the defined amount of semitones.

This stops the telemetry lost warnings when running a high telemetry ratio, or low rates like 50hz. Default value is 320LU . If you want to change that you have to suffix your milliseconds value with LU . For example, in order to specify 100 ms telemetry update rate you have to enter it like this: 100LU .

Do this at your own risk if you make no cooling modifications-- R9M modules will burn themselves out without cooling. #-DUNLOCK_HIGHER_POWER We published R9M Fan Mod Cover , a custom 3d printed backplate with room for a fan and extra cooling to allow for maximum power (1-2W depending on the mod).","title":"Output Power Limit"},{"location":"software/user-defines/#performance-options","text":"#-DNO_SYNC_ON_ARM no sync on arm doesn't transmit sync packets while armed. This is useful for racing as there is less time & packets wasted \ud83d\uddd1\ufe0f on sending sync packets. HOWEVER if you are doing serious long range \u26f0\ufe0f, keep this commented because in the case of a sustained failsafe, link can not be regained while armed. AUX1 is the channel ExpressLRS uses to detect \"ARMED\", and this feature assumes that a low value of the arm switch is disarmed, and a high value is armed . OpenTX can invert your switch if you prefer it to be mechanically inverted. It may be best not to enable no sync on arm when you are first setting up ExpressLRS as it can be a source of confusion. -DFEATURE_OPENTX_SYNC #-DFEATURE_OPENTX_SYNC_AUTOTUNE These features enable lower latency \ud83c\udfc3\u200d\u2642\ufe0f and offset from the OpenTX radio to the TX. The first lowers latency and should be kept enabled. The second is more experimental and can lower the offset from the radio by tuning it as close as possible to 0 , but is experimental (even in 1.0) and is best left disabled. Both require OpenTX 2.3.12 or above. In order to install it, you will have to use OpenTX companion application. Deviation radio users such as those with the T8SGv2/v3 should disable this feature. You can also use EdgeTX . -DLOCK_ON_FIRST_CONNECTION RF Mode Locking - When the RX is waiting for a connection, it cycles through all available rates waiting for a connection on each one. By default, ExpressLRS will go back to this mode after a disconnect (failsafe). If LOCK_ON_FIRST_CONNECTION is used, ELRS will not cycle after a disconnect, but instead just stay on whatever rate the last connection was. This makes connection re-establishment quick, because the RX is always listening at the proper rate. This is generally what everyone wants, but there is utility in being able to switch the TX to the lowest rate to get more range to re-establish a link with a downed model, which can't happen if the RX is locked at the previous rate. When cycling through the rates, the RX starts with the fastest packet rate and works down to the slowest, then repeats. It waits PACKET_INTERVAL * PACKS_PER_HOP * HOP_COUNT * 1.1 at each rate. Example: 4ms * 4 * 80 * 1.1 = 1.408s for 250Hz. The duration is extended 10x if a valid packet is received during that time. Even with LOCK_ON_FIRST_CONNECTION , the rate can be changed by changing the TX rate using ELRS.lua while connected, or by power cycling the RX. #-DUSE_DIVERSITY Enable antenna-switching diversity for RX that support it.","title":"Performance Options"},{"location":"software/user-defines/#compatability-options","text":"-DUART_INVERTED This only works with ESP32 based TXes (will not work with modules without built-in inversion/uninversion), but enables compatibility with radios that output inverted CRSF, such as the FrSky QX7, TBS Tango 2, RadioMaster TX16S.
