# **Protect Your Open-Source Project Before It's Too Late: A Legal Horror Story**

Running a successful open-source project is one of the most rewarding experiences for a developer community. It’s also a
journey full of unexpected challenges \- some technical, some human, and, as we’ve recently learned, some legal.

This post is both an update on the status of the ExpressLRS project and a cautionary tale for other maintainers of
widely adopted open-source software and hardware: **if your project becomes popular, you must take legal steps early to
protect its name and identity.**

## **What Happened**

Imagine spending years building an open-source project, only to find someone else trying to claim its name. On **August
25th, 2025**, we were notified that an individual, Christopher Henry Sauer (also known as “Christina Sauer”, “Chris
Sauer” and by the handles radiomistress, radio-mistress, radio.mistress) had applied to
register *ExpressLRS* as a trademark in **China** (Application No. 84786671).

On **August 27th, 2025**, this individual also registered the domain name expresslrs[.]dev.

On **September 8th, 2025**, we received further notification of another application from the same individual to register
*ExpressLRS* as a trademark in the **United States**
([Serial No. 99380841](https://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=99380841&caseSearchType=US_APPLICATION&caseType=DEFAULT&searchType=statusSearch)).

To be clear:

* These are **pending applications**, not successful registrations.
* Government trademark offices are currently reviewing the filings.
* If the applications are preliminarily accepted, they will then be published for a formal **opposition period**, during
  which ExpressLRS LLC and others may contest them.

While Christopher Henry Sauer was at one point an active member of our public Discord chat community, **this individual
was never considered part of the project team and is not associated with ExpressLRS in any official or unofficial
capacity**. Christopher Henry Sauer was recently banned from our community spaces in order to preserve a respectful and
collaborative environment.

These filings were made without any involvement or authorization from ExpressLRS LLC or the ExpressLRS development team.
If granted, they could limit how developers, contributors, and manufacturers use the ExpressLRS name \- threatening the
project’s open-source nature and causing confusion across the community. ExpressLRS LLC will formally oppose these
applications to ensure the project’s identity remains protected.

## **Protecting ExpressLRS**

In response, we have formed **ExpressLRS LLC** in the United States to represent the project’s interests and to hold our
trademarks.

We are in the process of registering the **ExpressLRS** trademark in key regions around the world to protect the project
and its community.

Every attempted registration by Christopher Henry Sauer will be formally opposed by ExpressLRS LLC. We are committed to
ensuring that the project’s name and identity remain in the hands of the community that built it.

On October 2nd, 2025, our legal counsel issued a cease-and-desist letter to Christopher Henry Sauer. The ExpressLRS
developers are fully committed to protecting this project and the community that has supported it. We will not allow the
trust, collaboration, and progress that make ExpressLRS possible to be undermined.

## **Why This Matters**

The ExpressLRS project has grown far beyond what any of us imagined when it began. Developers and contributors have
poured thousands of volunteer hours into creating the most capable open-source RC link available today. Manufacturers
and vendors have invested in bringing ExpressLRS-based hardware to pilots around the world.

This work has always been driven by a spirit of openness and collaboration \- not profit. It’s deeply discouraging that
we must now divert energy and project funds to defend our community’s work from misappropriation, instead of focusing
purely on improving the technology itself.

## **A Lesson for Other Open-Source Projects**

If your project gains traction, it’s not enough to just write great code or design great hardware. **Protect your
project name early.**

* Register a trademark in key markets as soon as you can.
* Form a legal entity to represent your community.
* Don’t assume goodwill will be enough to protect you.

These steps may feel unnecessary when your project is just starting, but waiting until it becomes popular can leave it
vulnerable.

If establishing your own legal entity isn't feasible, consider partnering with a fiscally sponsored Open Collective. OSC
can register and manage trademarks on behalf of your project, providing legal protection without the need for direct
incorporation. This service includes one hour of legal guidance and assistance with trademark registration and
enforcement. For more details,

## **How You Can Help**

Securing trademarks and handling legal opposition is costly, and our team is handling this responsibly but with limited
resources. If you believe in what we’re building and would like to support these efforts, monetary contributions can be
made through our [OpenCollective page](https://opencollective.com/expresslrs), and other forms of support can be
coordinated by contacting us at [info@expresslrs.org](mailto:info@expresslrs.org).

## **Looking Forward**

Despite this challenge, our mission hasn’t changed: to provide the world with the best open-source RC control system. We
remain committed to transparency, collaboration, and innovation, and we’re grateful for the continued support of our
incredible community.

Let this experience be a lesson for others in the open-source world: protect your projects early, so you can focus on
building instead of defending.
