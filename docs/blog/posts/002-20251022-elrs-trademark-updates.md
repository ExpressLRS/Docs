# **ExpressLRS Progresses Global Protection Thanks To Community Backing**

## **TL;DR**

**Good news**: The unauthorized trademark applications are gradually being rejected, and **ExpressLRS LLC** is making significant progress protecting the project's identity worldwide.

## **What's Happened Since Our Last Update**

When we published our [initial post on October 3rd](https://www.expresslrs.org/blog/2025/10/03/protect-your-open-source-project-before-its-too-late-a-legal-horror-story/), we were facing unauthorized trademark applications in China and the United States. Here's where things stand today:

### **China Application:**

The unauthorized Chinese trademark application (No. 84786671) has been **rejected outright** - in a way that cannot be appealed. This is tremendous news for the team and the community.

### **United States Application:**

Following our cease-and-desist letter sent on October 2nd, 2025, the attorney representing the unauthorized US trademark application has **withdrawn from the case entirely**. This means if the US Patent and Trademark Office finds any reason to reject the application, the applicant will have to navigate the process without legal representation.

We are now preparing a letter of protest to provide the examining attorney with additional grounds for rejection.

### **Domain Name:**

The expresslrs[.]dev domain that was registered on August 27th, 2025 has been **taken down**. The individual behind these attempts has also scrubbed much of their online presence, including their Github account, social media profiles and websites that referenced ExpressLRS.

## **Our Global Trademark Protection Efforts**

ExpressLRS LLC has been actively securing trademark registrations in key markets around the world. We have now filed trademark applications in:

* **United States** - Application filed and being processed  
* **European Union** - Application filed, covering all EU member states  
* **United Kingdom** - Application filed  
* **Canada** - Application filed  
* **Australia** - Application filed  
* **China** - Application recently submitted

Combined, these registrations represent the major markets where ExpressLRS hardware is manufactured and used.

### **Why These Specific Regions?**

We consulted with major manufacturers in the RC community to identify where trademark protection would be most critical. These regions represent:

* Where ExpressLRS hardware is manufactured  
* Where our largest user communities are located  
* Strategic markets to prevent future bad-faith filings

We're considering a few additional regions for filings where there's strong community support and manufacturer interest, though we're being mindful of the costs and processing times involved.

## **The Costs and Your Support**

Trademark registration is expensive, and contesting trademark registrations even more. Our current filings have cost in excess of **$7,500 USD** for the filings listed above, and an additional \~$2,000 USD in legal fees with additional costs yet to come for the remaining markets of interest, or any follow up legal assistance with the ongoing filings. Each country has different fee structures and timeframes, and further expenses may arise for certification once applications are approved, or for legal support in the event that any filings require appeal. We still have a long journey ahead of us.

Your donations through our [OpenCollective page](https://opencollective.com/expresslrs) have made this protection possible. Every contribution directly supports our legal defense and helps ensure ExpressLRS remains in the hands of the community that built it.

Since publishing our first blog post on this threat on 3rd October 2025, the community (including manufacturers) has donated over **$20,000 USD**.

We want to give special thanks to manufacturers and community members who stepped up immediately to support these efforts. Your quick response has been instrumental in our progress in protecting and supporting the ExpressLRS Community.

## **Legal Entity and Trademark Usage**

ExpressLRS LLC now officially represents the project and holds our trademarks. We're committed to using this legal structure to protect the community's interests. We have made updates to the main project [README.md](https://github.com/ExpressLRS/ExpressLRS/blob/master/README.md) to reflect this.

## **What Happens Next?**

* **Short-term**: We continue monitoring the unauthorized US trademark application and will file our letter of protest with the USPTO  
* **Medium-term**: We await decisions on our trademark applications in various countries (processing times range from 9-18 months depending on region)  
* **Long-term**: We establish clear trademark usage policies (in line with our existing manufacturer guidelines) and continue normal project development

## **Lessons Learned**

This experience has reinforced several critical lessons for open-source projects:

1. **Act early**: Don't wait until you're popular to establish legal protections  
2. **Be transparent**: The community rallied around us because we were open about the threat  
3. **Get help**: Whether through forming an LLC, partnering with Open Source Collective, or working with trademark attorneys - you need professional guidance. Legal protection costs real money. Factor it into your project sustainability planning.

## **Thank You**

The response from the ExpressLRS community has been overwhelming. Special thanks to:

* **Ian (Mads Tech)** for immediately covering this story and amplifying our message  
* **UAVfutures, Squadding Quads, UAV Tech, Drone Camps RC and Many other channels** who shared the story and rallied community support  
* **Manufacturers and vendors** who contributed to our legal defense fund  
* **Every community member** who shared our story and offered support  
* **Our legal counsel** for their expert guidance through this process

This challenge has actually strengthened our community and shown what's possible when people come together to protect something they believe in.

## **Looking Forward**

While we've made excellent progress, this isn't over yet. Trademark applications take time to process, and we remain vigilant against any future attempts to misappropriate the ExpressLRS name.

But here's what hasn't changed: our commitment to building the best open-source RC control system in the world. Every hour we can now spend on development instead of legal defense is a win for the community.

We'll continue providing updates as significant developments occur. In the meantime, thank you for being part of this journey.
