## Overview

The RX Scoreboard is a developer/troubleshooting feature that shows the outcome of every receiver packet cycle with a single character. Enable it with `-DPRINT_RX_SCOREBOARD` when compiling any RX environment and connect to the debug serial UART, usually the same as the CRSF output UART for most environments. 

‚ö†Ô∏è For that reason, it should not be enabled during normal RC control operations since it will get mixed in with real CRSF data sent to the FC.

## Example 500Hz 1:32 Scoreboard
