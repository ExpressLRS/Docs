ExpressLRS is hashtag blessed with the benefit of there being many receivers available from a variety of manufacturers. This begs the question "Which receiver is best?" There is no best receiver, there is only one that has the features you want for the price you want to pay in the size you want it. ExpressLRS does not recommend a specific brand or model, but provide the information to help you select the right receiver for your needs. The following page will list manufacturers and features to look out for on their recievers.

!!! note Note
    This list will list primarily 2.4GHz hardware with 900MHz only listed in the frequency category, as 2.4GHz has become a significantly larger portion of the ELRS market.

## Reciever Selection
This section exists to list out some common features of recievers and will give some examples of recievers with these features.

Each build is different, but these are reccomended things to look for when selecting a reciever:

  * **Whoops / Toothpicks / Light aircraft:** Size is probably the most important feature, with a light small receiver and an onboard antenna being the best choice.
  * **Racing Quads:** Size is again most important. Ceramic antennas could be less easily damaged, and the reduced range of tucking them inside the frame is fine due to the short flight range. An external 2.4GHz antenna dipole is still pretty easy to fit and can be tucked away for a small improvement over the ceramic, but comes with Chance of Choppage.
  * **Freestyle Quads:** Minimum size is no longer an issue so Nano-sized receivers are the best bet here. A LNA is going to give you better reception behind obstacles. External antennas are a benefit as well, but you need to trade off how unobstructed the antenna will be versus getting it chopped. Diversity is of marginal benefit.
  * **Long Range:** For sure you need an LNA, an external antenna, and a PA to extend the telemetry range. This isn't to say these are required for long range, 5km is achievable on a ceramic antenna receiver with no LNA/PA at 250Hz/100mW with a clear line of sight. Diversity is worth a lot more here. For absolute maximum range 900MHz can do more but 2.4GHz can still do 50+km

??? info "Frequency"

    ExpressLRS offers both 2.4GHz and 900MHz systems, with each only working with recievers and transmitters of the same frequency. 2.4GHz is the currently most popular frequency given it's legality, featureset and cost. 2.4GHz links offer the fastest packet rates allowing for a more locked in feel while piloting and still offer massive amounts of range. 900MHz is the original long range frequency and still can be great for high wifi pollution environments with slightly better penetration.

    For new users unless you plan on flying hundreds of kilometers or in a high noise environment we reccomend 2.4GHz hardware:

      * Happymodel EP Series
      * Radiomaster RP Series
      * NamimnoRC Flash Series

    If you have an R9 system or similar or plan on flying beyond reasonable ranges, some great 900MHz recievers include:

      * BetaFPV Nano900
      * Happymodel ES900RX
      * GEPRC Nano 900MHz
