ExpressLRS is hashtag blessed with the benefit of there being many receivers available from a variety of manufacturers. This begs the question "Which receiver is best?" There is no best receiver, there is only one that has the features you want for the price you want to pay in the size you want it. ExpressLRS does not recommend a specific brand or model, but provide the information to help you select the right receiver for your needs. The following page will list manufacturers and features to look out for on their recievers.

!!! note Note
    This list will list primarily 2.4GHz hardware with 900MHz only listed in the frequency category, as 2.4GHz has become a significantly larger portion of the ELRS market.
