## Check your Target
Because of the massive shortage of `STM32` Chips, there are more `ESP8285` based RXes on the market. These support WiFi updating, and can be easily distinguished with a few tricks. The simplest way to tell is if on the rear of the RX (the side without the U.fl/SMD antenna) there is a large white component with the label **RainSun** (pictured below). If this is not there, you have an STM32 based target, if it is you have an `_ESP_` target, and can update using Wifi!

## Betaflight Passthrough

Targets: 

- `NamimnoRC_VOYAGER_900_ESP_RX_via_BetaflightPassthrough` 
- `NamimnoRC_VOYAGER_900_RX_via_BetaflightPassthrough`

Once [wired properly](../../quick-start/rx-fcprep/#namimnorc-voyager-flash) to your FC, connect USB. Did your receiver powered up too (with both LEDs lit)? If so, disconnect USB, hold the bind button on your receiver, and reconnect to USB. The LED should start alternating between the Green and Red LEDs. Once it's alternating, you can then let go of the Bind Button.

If your receiver didn't get powered from USB, have a lipo ready and continue with the next steps. On the ExpressLRS Configurator, with your [Firmware Options](../../quick-start/firmware-options) set, click on **Build & Flash**. Like on the TX module, it will take a while on the first time. Watch out for the `Passthrough Init` stage. This stage will check your FC Configuration for the Serial RX UART (Software Inversion via "set serialrx_inverted" and Half Duplex mode via "set serialrx_halfduplex" will be checked; both should be off.)

Once `Retry... ` lines appear, connect a LiPo if your receiver isn't powered by the USB (i.e. power up your receiver and FC). On subsequent flash, you can have the LiPo plugged in and receiver powered up from the start.

Wait for this process to finish. It's done once the "Success" prompt is shown.

## Wifi Updating (ESP Only - Recommended)

Target: `NamimnoRC_VOYAGER_900_ESP_RX_via_WIFI`

With the receiver [wired properly](../../quick-start/rx-fcprep/#namimnorc-voyager-flash) to your FC, select the right target and set your [Firmware Options](../../quick-start/firmware-options) in the ExpressLRS Configurator.

**Build** the firmware. Once done, it should open a new window where the `firmware.bin` is. Do not close this window so you can easily navigate to it once it's time to upload the firmware into the receiver.

Power your Flight Controller by either connecting a LiPo or attaching the USB cable (if the receiver gets powered from USB via a 4v5 pad). The receiver's LED will blink slowly at first, and after 20s or 30s (can be adjusted via ExpressLRS Configurator using `AUTO_WIFI_ON_INTERVAL`), it should blink fast indicating it's on Wifi Hotspot Mode.

Connect to the Wifi Network the receiver has created. It should be named something like `ExpressLRS RX` with the same *expresslrs* password as the TX Module Hotspot. Navigate to the same web address as the TX Module (usually http://10.0.0.1). The Firmware upload page should load, and using the File Upload Form, navigate where the correct Receiver `firmware.bin` is (like with the Tx module, you can also drag-and-drop the firmware file into the form field or use the `Browse` or `Choose File` button). Click on the **Update** button and the firmware file will be uploaded and the update process should commence.

A white page should load momentarily with the message **Update Success! Rebooting...**. Wait a little bit (**you can wait until the LED on the Receiver starts to blink slowly again**) and the receiver should be updated. Power cycle and your module and receiver should now be bound (given you have updated the Tx Module as well, and that they have the same binding phrase and options).

## UART Updating (ESP Only)
Target: `NamimnoRC_VOYAGER_900_ESP_RX_via_UART`

Wire the receiver into the FTDI, with the TX on receiver connected to the Rx on the FTDI, and the RX on receiver connected to the Tx of the FTDI. Wire 5V and GND of the FTDI to 5V and GND of the Receiver. Press the button while powering the RX on, and release - the LED should now be solid.

Select the target and set your [Firmware Options](../../quick-start/firmware-options) and once done, click on **Build and Flash**.

## STLink Updating (STM32 Only)
Target: `NamimnoRC_VOYAGER_900_RX_via_STLINK`

The units provided to the documentation team did not have STM32 chips due to the chip shortage, however, the following should apply. Wire CLK, 3v3, GND and DIO to the recievers STLink pins.

Select the target and set your [Firmware Options](../../quick-start/firmware-options) and once done, click on **Build and Flash**.
