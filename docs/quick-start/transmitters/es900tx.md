## Flashing/Updating the ES900TX Firmware

!!! danger "Advisory"
    If you are flashing/updating your TX module via WiFi for the first time from the factory firmware, or from an older firmware, to ExpressLRS 3.x firmware, you will first need to flash it to version 2.5.2, then flash it with the [Repartitioner](https://github.com/ExpressLRS/repartitioner) binary [file](https://github.com/ExpressLRS/repartitioner/releases/download/1.0/repartitioner.bin) (right click, save as/save file as). Should it complain about Target Mismatch, just click `Flash Anyway`. Only then you can flash to 3.x firmware via WiFi.

    Joshua Bardwell has a video about it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kcRi1cHejM).

    Updating to 3.x via UART or ETX Passthrough doesn't require 2.5.2 firmware or the Repartitioner.

=== "via WiFi"

    </figure>

    === "Manual Upload via AP"

        !!! Info "Heads up!"
            This option is only possible if you haven't previously flashed or configured your TX Module with your Home WiFi SSID and Password or if it's unable to connect to said WiFi Network because the router is Off or unreachable.

        1. Launch the [ExpressLRS Configurator](../installing-configurator.md) on your Computer.
            ![Configurator Release]{ align=right }

            - Make sure `Official Releases` is active from the horizontal tab.
            - Ensure you select the Released version you want to flash into your TX module.

            <br clear="right" />

        2. Select the Device Category and Device target matching your hardware.

            - Device Category: 
                - `Happymodel 900 MHz`

            - Device: 
                - `HappyModel TX ES900TX`

        3. Set the Flashing Method to `WiFi`.

            <figure markdown>
            ![via WiFi](../../assets/images/Method_TX_WiFi.png)
            </figure>

        4. Set the [firmware options](../firmware-options.md) for your device.
            - Regulatory Domain (Mandatory. Choose the domain appropriate for the location or country you're flying).
            - Binding Phrase (Optional, but Highly Recommended. Note this phrase as it should be the same on your other devices, or they will not bind or sync).
            - Local WiFi Network Credentials (Optional. Will be used the next time the device goes into WiFi mode).
        5. Click the ++"Build"++ button.
            
            <figure markdown>
            ![Build]
            </figure>
            
        6. Once the Build process is done, a Temp folder window containing your firmware binaries should pop up.

            ![Temp TX]{ align=right }

            - Do not close this Temp folder because this is where you will take your firmware from in the later steps. If you are planning on using your phone or tablet to upload the firmware file later, copy the firmware file into your device.

            !!! tip "NOTICE"
                With the release of ExpressLRS 3.3.0 and ExpressLRS Configurator 1.6.0, only one file will show up. Use the `firmware.bin` file for the next steps.

            <br clear="right" />
            
        7. Press the ++"SYS"++ Key on your Radio to display the Tools Menu, where you can find the Lua Scripts.
            - Older Radios or those with only one Menu Key must long-press the ++context-menu++ Key to access the System Menu.
            - Consult your Radio User's Manual on how to access the System Menu.

        8. Scroll down and select `ExpressLRS` Lua Script.

            <figure markdown>
            ![Lua Script]
            </figure>

            - If the script is nowhere to be found, download it from [this page](../transmitters/lua-howto.md) and save it into your Radio SD Card Scripts/Tools/ folder.

        9. Press ++enter++ to Load it.

            <figure markdown>
            ![Lua Running]
            </figure>

            - If the script is stuck on a "Loading..." screen, return to the [Radio Preparation](../transmitters/tx-prep.md) Page and make sure you have configured your radio properly for ExpressLRS use.
        10. Scroll down and select `Wifi Connectivity` and press ++enter++.
        11. Select `Enable WiFi` and press ++enter++.

            <figure markdown>
            ![Lua WiFi]
            </figure>

        12. The `WiFi Running` screen will show up. Your TX module is now in WiFi mode.
            - Do not worry if the Script stops and shows a Syntax Error. The module is still in WiFi mode. The Syntax Error could be because you're on an older radio, older EdgeTX/OpenTX firmware, or both. It could also be because your TX module is on an earlier firmware version, and you're using a more recent Lua Script.

        13. Using a WiFi-capable device such as your smartphone or laptop, scan for the `ExpressLRS TX` Access Point. Connect to this Access Point.

            ![WiFi Hotspot](../../assets/images/WifiHotspotTX.png){ align=right }

            - If your TX Module is previously flashed with your Home WiFi SSID and Password, and it is able to connect to that WiFi Network, then the Access Point will not show up.
            - `expresslrs` is the Password for this Access Point.

            ??? question "Where's the Access Point?"
                If you cannot find the Access Point, make sure the device you're using is capable of connecting to 2.4GHz WiFi Networks. Also try putting the devices closer together.
                
                If you still cannot find the Access Point, chances are that you have set it with your WiFi SSID and Password before, and it has connected to your WiFi Network.

            <br clear="right" />

        14. Once connected to the `ExpressLRS TX` Access Point, open up a Browser window, type in the IP Address `10.0.0.1` on the Address Bar, and press ++enter++. The ExpressLRS Web UI will load.
        15. Activate the `Update` Tab.

            <figure markdown>
            ![TX update tab]
            </figure>

            - If your TX Module is still on an earlier firmware version, then there's no Update Tab, and instead, you will need to scroll down to find the Firmware Update section.

            <figure markdown>
            ![Old File Upload]
            </figure>

        16. Drag and drop the Firmware file from the Temp folder into the File Upload field.
            - You can also use the Browse or Choose File button and browse for the file yourself, especially if you've copied/moved it somewhere else on an earlier step.
        17. Click the ++"Update"++ button to start the Updating procedure.
        18. Wait for the firmware file to get uploaded and flashed into your device. It only takes a minute or two, and you will see the Success Popup Message.

            <figure markdown>
            ![Success WiFi]
            </figure>

        19. On your Radio, the `WiFi Running` screen should disappear and should be back to the WiFi Connectivity Menu of the ExpressLRS Lua Script.
        20. Long-press the ++"RTN"++ Key to exit the ExpressLRS Lua Script. Then reload it to check for the ExpressLRS Firmware version and verify your TX module has been updated.

    7. A Temp folder will open up with the **firmware.elrs** file. Copy-paste the firmware.elrs file into your Radio's SD Card (preferably to the `/FIRMWARE` folder for easy access).

    8. On your radio, open the System Menu. 

        - On newer radios, you can press the ++"SYS"++ key to open the System Menu
        - On older radios, or radios that only have a menu key, long-press the ++context-menu++ key to open the System Menu

    9. Using the ++"Page"++ key/s, navigate to the SD-HC Card page, scroll-down and open the `FIRMWARE` folder where you can find the **firmware.elrs** file.

    10. Highlight the file and press-hold the ++"Enter"++ button and select "Flash External ELRS". Wait for the firmware to be written.

        ??? tip "No Sync"
            - Make sure you have updated the OpenTX/EdgeTX firmware of your radio to a newer version
            - Make sure the current model selected on the radio is set up for ExpressLRS Use. See the [Radio Preparation] guide.

    11. With the [ExpressLRS Lua Script] in the Tools page, verify if the firmware version has been updated.
