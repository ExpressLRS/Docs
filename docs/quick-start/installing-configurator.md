There are two ways to build & flash ExpressLRS. The recommended way is to use ExpressLRS Configurator. For advanced users who want to modify the code, you can setup the development toolchain.

## Configurator Setup

[Download](https://github.com/ExpressLRS/ExpressLRS-Configurator/releases) the latest ExpressLRS Configurator application for your platform, following the instructions written by [jurgelenas](https://github.com/jurgelenas/).

Go to the [supported hardware](https://github.com/ExpressLRS/ExpressLRS/wiki/Supported-Hardware) page to find the correct target for your hardware.


## Toolchain Setup

**Note:** The following section is intended for advanced users who intend to dabble with the source code directly. If you're not familiar with Programming and Development Environments, **STOP** and proceed to the next step.

`ExpressLRS` is written in C++ using the Arduino framework. 

 * Rather than using the Arduino IDE (which let's face it, 🗿 is pretty clunky), we use [platformio](https://platformio.org/)
 * To ease the use of `pio` we recommend to use the [according extension](https://platformio.org/install/ide?install=vscode) for `Visual Studio Code`

### PlatformIO

1. 🔽 **Download** a copy of [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for your computer 
2. 📂 **Open** vscode, and click on the "__Extensions__" icon in the toolbar on the right (see [Managing Extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery) 📘)
3. 🔎 In the search box, enter `platformio`, and **install** the **extension** (see [the `pio install` documentation](https://platformio.org/install/ide?install=vscode) 📚)

### Git Setup

We recommend using VSCode's built-in Git client, as it requires the least 3rd party software 🤖.

1. 🔽 **Download** a copy of [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (this is also needed for `PlatformIO`)
2. Install `git`, click **yes** to the default options (there are a **LOT** 💯)
3. IMPORTANT! Make sure you select this option during install, it adds git to PATH which is necessary for VScode cloning (the next step).

### Cloning the Repo
* In VSCode open the `command pallete` (using `Cmd+Shift+P` on MacOS or `Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows)
* Enter `Git: Clone`

* Click that! 👈 
* Then, enter ExpressLRS Repo URL -> `https://github.com/AlessandroAU/ExpressLRS.git` 💻 
* Choose a folder for ExpressLRS. 📂 

### Selecting the Latest Release
Before we can do any building, you need to select a release build of ELRS. For example, release [0.1.0-RC1](https://github.com/AlessandroAU/ExpressLRS/releases/tag/0.1.0-RC1). In Visual Studio Code select that tag. The location of the selector is shown below. 🖱️

Click the selector, and then type in the name of the tag, in this case `0.1.0-RC1`. 

### PlatformIO Building

Once you had the time of your life setting up your toolchain 🧰 you are **ready** to Flash ⚡ ExpressLRS to supported [hardware](https://github.com/AlessandroAU/ExpressLRS/wiki/Supported-Off-The-Shelf-Hardware).

### Building Targets using PlatformIO

1. 📂 When you first launch `Visual Studio Code`, you should see the `PlatformIO Home Page` in a tab.
Click the `Open Project` button. Navigate to the `ExpressLRS` repo directory. Navigate into the `src` folder (i.e. `./ExpressLRS/src/`). Finally, press the `Open` button.
2. ✏️ Edit the file [`./src/user_defines.txt`](https://github.com/AlessandroAU/ExpressLRS/blob/master-dev/src/user_defines.txt) to define user specific variabls. 😈 Please make sure you did edit the file according to __your__ needs! 
3. 📊 In the toolbar on the left, click the PlatformIO icon, which will show the list of tasks. Now, select Project Tasks, expand your desired target and select Build/Upload (depending on the method). You should see the result in the terminal.
4. 🙃 If something went wrong - please check the `Terminal`, too. It will contain at least a hint on what the issue is. Please ask the [community](https://github.com/AlessandroAU/ExpressLRS/wiki#community) for further help🧑‍🔧!
