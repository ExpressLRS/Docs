# Flashing Ghost Atto/Zepto RX's

Target: `GHOST_ATTO_2400_RX_via_STLINK`

Flashing the Ghost RX's is currently a **1 WAY** flash once you flash ExpressLRS to these RX's you **will not** be able to use them with Ghost TX.  You will need a `StLink V2` to flash the RX's

1. Wire `3.3v`, `GND`, `CLK`, and `DIO` to their respective pins on the RX from the StLink.
2. Select the `GHOST_ATTO_2400_via_STLINK` target.
3. Set your [Firmware Options](../../quick-start/firmware-options) and click on `Build and Flash`.
4. Connect your receiver to your Flight Controller as normal (i.e. Rx to Tx, and Tx to Rx);

Subsequent Firmware Updates can now be done using `via_BetaflightPassthrough` target.
