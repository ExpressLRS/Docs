## Bootloaders

The R9Mini/R9MM, R9MX and R9Slim+ require ExpressLRS Bootloaders to be flashed first **BEFORE** you can flash the ExpressLRS firmwares into them. The R9Slim doesn't have a bootloader. As such, first time flash requires STLink.

Download the bootloader `.frk` file for your respective receiver. The files are as follows:

- R9mm/mini: [`r9mm_elrs_bl.frk`](https://github.com/AlessandroAU/ExpressLRS/blob/master/src/bootloader/r9mm_elrs_bl.frk?raw=true) (14kb) or [`r9mm_no_btn_elrs_bl.frk`](https://github.com/ExpressLRS/ExpressLRS/raw/master/src/bootloader/r9mm_no_btn_elrs_bl.frk?raw=true) (14kb) (no_btn bootloader is only used if your bind/boot button on the receiver is faulty or has gone bad.)
- R9mx: [`r9mx_elrs_bl.frk`](https://github.com/ExpressLRS/ExpressLRS/blob/master/src/bootloader/r9mx_elrs_bl.frk?raw=true) (20kb)
- R9Slim+ (ACCST): [`r9slim_plus_elrs_bl.frk`](https://github.com/ExpressLRS/ExpressLRS/blob/master/src/bootloader/r9slim_plus_elrs_bl.frk?raw=true) (14kb)
- R9Slim+ (ACCESS/OTA): [`r9slim_plus_ota_elrs_bl.frk`](https://github.com/ExpressLRS/ExpressLRS/blob/master/src/bootloader/r9slim_plus_ota_elrs_bl.frk?raw=true) (18kb)

Copy the relevant file to your handset's SD card (You can put it inside `/FIRMWARE` folder for easy access).

Wire the receiver to your radio's Smart Port, as shown:

<br />

Next, flash the `.frk` via the `S.port` flashing option in `OpenTX` or `EdgeTX` :zap: (It helps if the External RF module is set to `PPM` mode.) 

  * Navigate in OpenTX to the TOOLS menu (hold SYS button)
  * Press Page once to the SD-HC CARD page, then select the `FIRMWARE` folder
  * Flash the frk file by holding OK/Enter and selecting "Flash external module"

Once done, unplug the receiver and your bootloader is flashed.

!!! info "FYI"
    You only need to flash the Bootloader ONCE. After it's flashed into the receiver, you **don't** have to reflash it in every update.

    R9Slim doesn't have a bootloader. As such, you need to flash it first via FTDI.

### Troubleshooting No Sync

- Setting the External RF module to `PPM` mode helps.
- Check if the receiver has its LED lit up or if it's powered.
- Check whether you've set your `Max Bauds` to `115200`, especially if you're using a **QX7** or an **X9D** (on OneBit Firmwares or EdgeTX). If so, put it back to 400k and try again.

## Wiring it up

!!! attention ""
    Note: This will be the same wiring you'll use for flying and the subsequent firmware updates (via Passthrough). Forget the factory wiring guide!

    R9Slim need to be flashed via STLink first before you wire it up to your Flight Controller.

## Configuring your Flight Controller

See this [page](configuring-fc.md) on how your flight controller should be configured. These settings apply on both INAV and Betaflight (and other flight controller software).

Ports Tab should be setup so that Serial RX is on the UART where you have soldered the receiver.

Receiver protocol is `CRSF`, with `serialrx_inverted = off` and `serialrx_halfduplex = off`.

The next step will not be able to proceed properly and you'll have issues later if any of these are set differently. Once you have configured your Flight Controller software, close its Configurator and unplug-replug the USB cable from the FC or your computer. This will refresh the connection and you'll be ensured that the port is not busy.

## Passthrough Flashing (works with Betaflight, INAV)

Valid Targets:

- `Frsky_RX_R9MM_R9MINI_via_BetaflightPassthrough`
- `Frsky_RX_R9MX_via_BetaflightPassthrough`
- `Frsky_RX_R9SLIM_via_BetaflightPassthrough`
- `Frsky_RX_R9SLIMPLUS_via_BetaflightPassthrough`
- `Frsky_RX_R9SLIMPLUS_OTA_via_BetaflightPassthrough`

Device Category: `Frsky R9`

Device:

- `Frsky RX R9MM R9MINI`
- `Frsky RX R9MX`
- `Frsky RX R9SLIM` (IF already flashed via STLink)
- `Frsky RX R9SLIMPLUS`
- `Frsky RX R9SLIMPLUS OTA`

![via Passthrough](../../assets/images/Method_RX_Passthrough-stm.png)

Make sure the correct [Bootloader] has been flashed to the receiver prior to wiring it up to your flight controller. Using the wiring guide above, find a free, uninverted UART in your FC. You can use your FC's wiring guide for a Crossfire or Ghost receiver.

Set up your Flight Controller for ExpressLRS. Make sure you have set Serial RX to the right UART (RX & TX Pair) under the Ports Tab. Follow the [FC Configuration Guide].

Once wired to your FC, connect USB. Did your receiver powered up too (with both LEDs lit)? If so, disconnect USB, hold the bind button on your receiver, and reconnect to USB. The LED should start alternating between the Green and Red LEDs. Once it's alternating, you can then let go of the Bind Button.

If your receiver didn't get powered from USB, have a lipo ready and continue with the next steps. On the ExpressLRS Configurator, with your [Firmware Options] set, click on **Build & Flash**. Like on the TX module, it will take a while on the first time. Watch out for the `Passthrough Init` stage. This stage will check your FC Configuration for the Serial RX UART (Software Inversion via "set serialrx_inverted" and Half Duplex mode via "set serialrx_halfduplex" will be checked; both should be off.)

![Build & Flash](../../assets/images/BuildFlash.png)

Once `Retry... ` lines appear, connect a LiPo if your receiver isn't powered by the USB (i.e. power up your FC and receiver). On subsequent flash, you can have the LiPo plugged in and receiver powered up from the start prior to connecting the USB.

Wait for this process to finish. It's done once the "Success" prompt is shown.

## Flashing via STLink

!!! Attention
    R9Slim requires this as the first flashing method. This is irreversible, meaning you can't put back Frsky firmware.

Valid Targets:

- `Frsky_RX_R9MM_R9MINI_via_STLINK`
- `Frsky_RX_R9MX_via_STLINK`
- `Frsky_RX_R9SLIM_via_STLINK`
- `Frsky_RX_R9SLIMPLUS_via_STLINK`
- `Frsky_RX_R9SLIMPLUS_OTA_via_STLINK`

Device Category: `Frsky R9`

Device:

- `Frsky RX R9MM R9MINI`
- `Frsky RX R9MX`
- `Frsky RX R9SLIM`
- `Frsky RX R9SLIMPLUS`
- `Frsky RX R9SLIMPLUS OTA`

![via STLink](../../assets/images/Method_RX_STLink-stm.png)

This method is irreversible. It will remove the ability to reflash back to Frsky firmware. You have been warned! Make sure your STLink dongle is properly recognized by your System as such (Drivers are installed, etc.).

Wire up the Receiver to your STLink using `3v3`, `GND`, `CLK` and `DIO`.

Disable 'Readout Protection'. To do this download the [ST-LINK Utility](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stsw-link004.html) and follow this quick [how to video](https://youtu.be/SEYQ1HpRmk0). Or alternatively under linux you can use [OpenOCD](../../software/open-ocd.md).

After doing so, `Disconnect` from STLink Utility.

Using the correct target specific for your receiver, set your [Firmware Options] and hit **Build & Flash** on the ExpressLRS Configurator.

Once done, [wire] your receiver to your Flight Controller. Passthrough flashing can now be used for updating the receiver.
