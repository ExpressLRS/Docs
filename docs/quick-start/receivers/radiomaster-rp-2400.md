!!! danger "Advisory"
    If this is the first time you're flashing/updating your receiver or you're updating it from a previous 2.x firmware, first ensure that it has version 2.5.1. Once it has the 2.5.1 flashed, update to 3.x.

    If you've flashed it straight to 3.x and you're getting "Not Enough Space" popup during WiFi flashing, flash the receiver to 2.5.1 first, and then flash it to 3.x.

    The Repartitioner is for **TX only**.

## Wiring up your receiver

!!! attention "Note"
    There are Flight Controllers that will pull the RX pads `LOW` which will put the ESP-based receivers into `Bootloader Mode` unintentionally. A solid LED light on these receivers even with the TX module off is a sign they are in Bootloader Mode. If this is the case, rewire the receiver to a different UART.

</figure>

The images above show the receivers' pinouts and their connections. As we're dealing with UART connection, Rx on the receiver goes to a TX pad on the FC, and Tx on the receiver goes to an uninverted Rx pad on the FC.

There are Flight Controllers that put their Receiver UART's RX pads Low, which in turn, puts the ESP-based (e.g. EP1 and EP2) receivers to Bootloader mode unintentionally. One remedy is to wire them into a different UART, or wire a pull-up resistor (300-1k ohm) between the Rx pad of the FC and a 3.3v or 5v pad, as shown below.

<figure markdown>
![pull up](../../assets/images/pull-up.png)
<figcaption>Wiring up receiver</figcaption>
</figure>

Also of note is that the RP receivers need to be put into Bootloader mode manually on first time Passthrough Flash from their factory firmwares. To put any of these receivers into Bootloader mode, solder one end of a piece of wire into the Boot pad and the other end to the Ground pad. After the first succcessful passthrough flashing, the Boot pad connection to Ground should be removed. Subsequent passthrough flashing doesn't require the Boot pads connection to Ground.

Flashing via Wifi doesn't need the Boot pad to be connected to Ground. Moreover, if it is connected, the receiver will stay in bootloader mode and won't activate its WiFi Mode.

## Configuring your Flight Controller

To configure your flight controller properly, please go through [Configure FC page](configuring-fc.md). These settings apply on INAV, Betaflight and other flight controller software.

Ports Tab should be setup so that Serial RX is on the UART where you have soldered the receiver.

Receiver protocol is `CRSF` with `serialrx_inverted = off` and `serialrx_halfduplex = off`.

The next step will not be able to proceed properly and you'll have issues later if any of these are set differently. Once you have configured your Flight Controller software, close its Configurator and unplug-replug the USB cable from the FC or your computer. This will refresh the connection and you'll be ensured that the port is not busy (of high importance with the Passthrough Flashing Method).

### Method 1

**(Recommended as first-flash method)**

Before your proceed, make sure you have the receiver [wired properly] to your FC.

**Build** the firmware using the ExpressLRS Configurator using the correct Target and [Firmware Options]. Once done, it should open a new window where the `RM_RP_2400RX-<version>.bin` is. Do not close this window so you can easily navigate to it once it's time to upload the firmware into the receiver.

<figure markdown>
![Build]
</figure>

Power your Flight Controller by either connecting a LiPo or attaching the USB cable (if receiver gets powered from USB via a 4v5 pad). Receiver's LED will blink slow at first, and after 20s or 30s (can be adjusted via ExpressLRS Configurator using `AUTO_WIFI_ON_INTERVAL`), it should blink fast indicating it's on Wifi Hotspot Mode.

<figure markdown>

</figure>

Connect to the Wifi Network the receiver has created. It should be named something like `ExpressLRS RX` with the same `expresslrs` password as the TX Module Hotspot.

<figure markdown>
![WiFi Hotspot](../../assets/images/WifiHotspot.png)
</figure>

Navigate to the same web address as the TX Module (usually http://10.0.0.1). The Firmware upload page should load, and using the File Upload Form, navigate where the correct Receiver `RM_RP_2400RX-<version>.bin` is (like with the Tx module, you can also drag-and-drop the firmware file into the form field or use the `Browse` or `Choose File` button). Click on **Update** button and the firmware file will be uploaded and the update process should commence. 

A white page should load momentarily with the message **Update Success! Rebooting...**. Wait a little bit (**you can wait until the LED on the Receiver starts to blink slowly again**) and the receiver should be updated. Power cycle the receiver and it should be able to bind with your TX module now (given you have updated the Tx Module as well, and that they have the same binding phrase and options).

!!! Info "Update for version 2.0"
    Once you have updated to firmware version 2.0 or newer, the Web Update page on the Hotspot will get a few updates of its own. It will get the Update progress bar, and a Popup will be shown for Success or Error messages. Additionally, you can configure Home Network SSID and Password if you chose not to use ExpressLRS Configurator to set them. Once these are set, you can use the two methods below.

![JoinNetwork](../../assets/images/web-joinnetwork.png)
</figure>

### Method 2

!!! note "Note"
    This method will only work once the Home Network SSID and Password has been configured with the receiver.

With the receiver [wired properly] to your FC, select the right target and set your [Firmware Options] in the ExpressLRS Configurator.

**Build** the firmware. Once done, it should open a new window where the `RM_RP_2400RX-<version>.bin` is. Do not close this window so you can easily navigate to it once it's time to upload the firmware into the receiver.

<figure markdown>
![Build]
</figure>

Power up your Flight Controller by either connecting a LiPo or attaching the USB cable (if the receiver gets powered from USB via a 4v5 pad). The receiver's LED will blink slowly at first, and after 20s or 30s (can be adjusted via ExpressLRS Configurator using `AUTO_WIFI_ON_INTERVAL`), it should blink fast indicating it's on Wifi AP Mode. The fast blink will pause and flash fast once again, indicating connection to your Home Network.

</figure>

Using your browser, navigate to http://elrs_rx.local/. The Wifi Update page should load. It should show your device target along with the version of the firmware it currently has.

Scroll down to the Firmware Update section, shown below:

<figure markdown>
![Firmware Update](../../assets/images/web-firmwareupdate.png)
</figure>

Drag-and-drop the `RM_RP_2400RX-<version>.bin` file created by the ExpressLRS Configurator into the Choose File field, or manually navigate to the Folder by clicking the `Choose File` button. Once the correct file is selected, click the `Update`. Wait for the process to complete, indicated by a Green popup screen. 

Wait a little bit (**you can wait until the LED on the Receiver starts to blink slowly again**) and the receiver should be updated.

You can now power down your Flight Controller along with the receiver.

### Method 3

!!! note "Note"
    This method will only work once the Home Network SSID and Password has been configured with the receiver.

With the receiver [wired properly] to your FC, select the right target and set your [Firmware Options] in the ExpressLRS Configurator.

Power up your Flight Controller by either connecting a LiPo or attaching the USB cable (if the receiver gets powered from USB via a 4v5 pad). The receiver's LED will blink slowly at first, and after 20s or 30s (can be adjusted via ExpressLRS Configurator using `AUTO_WIFI_ON_INTERVAL`), it should blink fast indicating it's on Wifi Mode.

</figure>

**Build & Flash** the firmware using the ExpressLRS Configurator. Wait for the process to complete, indicated by the "Success" prompt and the Receiver LED has gone back to the Slow Blink mode. You can now power down the Flight Controller.

## Flashing via Passthrough

- Target: `HappyModel_EP_2400_RX_via_BetaflightPassthrough`

- Device Category: `RadioMaster 2.4 GHz`

- Device: `RadioMaster RP1/2 2400 RX`

<figure markdown>
![via Passthrough](../../assets/images/Method_RX_Passthrough.png)
<figcaption>Flashing via Passthrough</figcaption>
</figure>

Make sure you have your receiver [wired properly]. Rx pad on the Receiver wired up to a Tx pad on the FC, and the Tx pad on the Receiver wired up to an Rx pad on the FC. Also make sure you have setup your FC firmware to use CRSF Protocol, and that the UART is not inverted or running in half duplex.

For the following steps, you should be disconnected from Betaflight or INAV Configurator. Close the FC Configurator and unplug the FC from USB to refresh the connection.

You will need to solder one end of a piece of wire into the Boot pad and the other end into the Ground pad the first time you'll be updating with this method to manually put the receiver into Bootloader mode. The [Wiring Guide] shows where the `Boot` pad is. A solid LED indicates the receiver is in `Bootloader` mode when the TX module is OFF (Solid LED also indicates Radio+module & Receiver is bound and has connection). 

!!! attention "Note"
    If you haven't shorted the `Boot` pad to ground but the receiver has solid LED light, your FC is probably pulling the current UART's RX pad `LOW` which will interfere with the normal and passthrough flashing of this receiver. Find another UART and wire your receiver there instead.

Power your FC with a LiPo, or if receiver is powered via USB (receiver is connected to a 4v5 pad), connect the FC to your USB port. Using the ExpressLRS Configurator, with the correct Target selected and [Firmware Options] set, click on **Build & Flash**. Wait for the process to finish and you should be greeted with the "Success" banner.

<figure markdown>
![Build & Flash]
</figure>

Unplug USB and LiPo, and remove the wire connecting the `Boot` pad to Ground. Power your TX Module and then your FC to verify you are bound and has connection.

## Flashing via FTDI

- Target: `HappyModel_EP_2400_RX_via_UART`

- Device Category: `RadioMaster 2.4 GHz`

- Device: `RadioMaster RP1/2 2400 RX`

<figure markdown>
![via UART](../../assets/images/Method_RX_UART.png)
<figcaption>Flashing via UART</figcaption>
</figure>

Wire the receiver into the FTDI, with TX on receiver connected to the Rx on the FTDI, and RX on receiver connected to the Tx of the FTDI. Wire 5V and GND of the FTDI to 5V and GND of the Receiver. Solder one end of a piece of wire into the Boot pad and the other end into the Ground pad then connect the FTDI Adapter to a USB port - the LED should now be solid.

<figure markdown>
![FTDI Wiring](../../assets/images/FTDIConn.png)
</figure>

Select the target and set your [Firmware Options] then click on **Build and Flash**.

<figure markdown>
![Build & Flash]
