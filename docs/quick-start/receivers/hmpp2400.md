## Wiring up your receiver

<figure markdown>

The image above show the receiver pinout and their connections. As we're dealing with UART connection, Rx on receiver goes to a TX pad in the FC, and Tx on Receiver goes to an uninverted Rx pad on the FC.

!!! note "Note"
    The PP doesn't have a `Boot` pad so there's no need to bridge any pads.

## Configuring your Flight Controller

To configure your flight controller properly, please go through [Configure FC page](configuring-fc.md). These settings apply on INAV, Betaflight and other flight controller software.

Ports Tab should be setup so that Serial RX is on the UART where you have soldered the receiver.

Receiver protocol is `CRSF` with `serialrx_inverted = off` and `serialrx_halfduplex = off`.

The next step will not be able to proceed properly and you'll have issues later if any of these are set differently. Once you have configured your Flight Controller software, close its Configurator and unplug-replug the USB cable from the FC or your computer. This will refresh the connection and you'll be ensured that the port is not busy (of high importance with the Passthrough Flashing Method).

## Updating your Receiver Firmware

=== "via Passthrough"

    <figure markdown>
    ![via Passthrough](../../assets/images/Method_RX_Passthrough-stm.png)
    </figure>

    1. Make sure you have done your [Receiver Wiring] properly and that your Flight Controller is [Configured].

        !!! Warning "Important Step!"
            This is an important step and guarantees updating success. If you haven't done these, GO BACK to those pages.

        - Disconnect and close Betaflight Configurator or INAV Configurator.
        - Power-cycle the Flight Controller.
            - If you plugged in LiPo, unplug it.
            - Unplug-replug the USB Cable from your Flight Controller or Computer.
            - If you will have to plug in LiPo to power up your Receiver, make sure you have some airflow blowing over your Video Transmitter (VTX). You can also temporarily unplug it from the Flight Controller.

    2. Launch the [ExpressLRS Configurator](../installing-configurator.md) on your Computer.
        ![Configurator Release]{ align=right }

        - Make sure Official Releases is active from the horizontal tab.
        - Make sure you have selected the Released version you want to flash into your TX module.

        <br clear="right" />
    3. Select the Device Category and Device target matching your hardware.

        - Device Category: `Happymodel 2.4 GHz`

        - Device: `HappyModel PP 2400 RX`

    4. Set the Flashing Method to `BetaflightPassthrough`

        </figure>

    5. Set the [firmware options] for your device.
        - Regulatory Domain (Mandatory. Choose the domain appropriate for the location or country you're flying).
        - Binding Phrase (Optional, but Highly Recommended. Take note of this phrase as this should be the same on your other devices or they will not bind or sync).

    6. Click the ++"Build & Flash"++ button.

    7. Wait for the `Retry...` lines to appear in the Build Log. Connect the LiPo to power up the Receiver if it only powers up with a LiPo connected.

        - `Retry...` lines will not show up if your receiver is already in bootloader mode and gets powered up by USB.
        
    8. Wait for the process to finish. A Green Success bar will show up in the ExpressLRS Configurator.

    9. The LED on the Receiver should return to Slow Blinking LED after a few seconds.

=== "via STLink"

    <figure markdown>
    ![via STLink](../../assets/images/Method_RX_STLink-stm.png)
    </figure>

    1. Disconnect the Receiver from your Flight Controller.

    2. Wire up the Receiver into an STLink V2 dongle. Find the CLK, DIO, 3v3 and Gnd pads and wire them straight up.

    3. Launch the [ExpressLRS Configurator](../installing-configurator.md) on your Computer.
        ![Configurator Release]{ align=right }

        - Make sure Official Releases is active from the horizontal tab.
        - Make sure you have selected the Released version you want to flash into your TX module.

    4. Select the Device Category and Device target matching your hardware.

        - Device Category: `Happymodel 2.4 GHz`

        - Device: `HappyModel PP 2400 RX`

    5. Set the Flashing Method to `STLink`

        <figure markdown>
        ![via STLink](../../assets/images/Method_RX_STLink-stm.png)

    5. Set the [firmware options] for your device.
        - Regulatory Domain (Mandatory. Choose the domain appropriate for the location or country you're flying).
        - Binding Phrase (Optional, but Highly Recommended. Take note of this phrase as this should be the same on your other devices or they will not bind or sync).
        - Local WiFi Network Credentials (Optional. Will be used the next time the device goes into WiFi mode).
    6. Click the ++"Build & Flash"++ button.
