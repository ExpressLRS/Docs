Targets: 

- `Jumper_RX_R900MINI_via_STLINK`
- `Jumper_RX_R900MINI_via_BetaflightPassthrough`

Disable 'Readout Protection'. To do this download the [ST-LINK Utility](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stsw-link004.html) and follow this quick [how to video](https://youtu.be/SEYQ1HpRmk0). Or alternatively under linux you can use [OpenOCD](../../software/open-ocd/).

Using the correct target specific for your receiver, and your [Firmware Options](../../quick-start/firmware-options/) set, click **Build & Flash** on the ExpressLRS Configurator.

After the flash is successful, desolder the STLink and connect RX2 and TX2 (you will need to solder on the STM32 pins, see picture) to a flight controller and setting up the receiver with the CRSF serial protocol, the `Jumper_RX_R900MINI_via_BetaflightPassthrough` target may now be used for future firmware.
