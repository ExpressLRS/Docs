For hardware that requires STLink v2 flashing, this guide simply explains how to wire the given piece of hardware to the StLink before that flashing.

## FrSky Recievers
This guide applies for the R9mm, R9mini, R9mx, R9Slim, R9Slim+, R9Slim+ OTA, if you have a `OpenTX` transmitter with a `SmartPort` output, you can flash your RXes bootloader.

Download the bootloader `.frk` file for your respective receiver. The files are as follows:

- R9mm/mini: [`r9mm_elrs_bl.frk`](https://github.com/AlessandroAU/ExpressLRS/blob/master/src/bootloader/r9mm_elrs_bl.frk?raw=true) (14kb) or [`r9mm_no_btn_elrs_bl.frk`](https://github.com/ExpressLRS/ExpressLRS/raw/master/src/bootloader/r9mm_no_btn_elrs_bl.frk?raw=true) (14kb) (no_btn bootloader is only used if your bind/boot button on the receiver is faulty or has gone bad, and is indicated by both LEDs (red and green) being constantly illuminated.)
- R9mx: [`r9mx_elrs_bl.frk`](https://github.com/ExpressLRS/ExpressLRS/blob/master/src/bootloader/r9mx_elrs_bl.frk?raw=true) (20kb)
- R9Slim+ (ACCST): [`r9slim_plus_elrs_bl.frk`](https://github.com/ExpressLRS/ExpressLRS/blob/master/src/bootloader/r9slim_plus_elrs_bl.frk?raw=true) (14kb)
- R9Slim+ (ACCESS/OTA): [`r9slim_plus_ota_elrs_bl.frk`](https://github.com/ExpressLRS/ExpressLRS/blob/master/src/bootloader/r9slim_plus_ota_elrs_bl.frk?raw=true) (18kb)

Copy the relevant file to your handset's SD card (You can put it inside `/FIRMWARE` folder for easy access).

Wire the receiver to your radio's Smart Port, as shown:

<br />

Next, flash the `.frk` via the `S.port` flashing option in `OpenTX`. :zap: (It helps if the External RF module is set to `PPM` mode.) 

  * Navigate in OpenTX to the TOOLS menu (hold SYS button)
  * Page to the SD-HC CARD page, then the `FIRMWARE` folder
  * Flash the frk file by holding OK and selecting "Flash external module"

Unplug the receiver, and your bootloader is flashed. **Continue to the next page to set up your user defines.**


## FrSky Transmitters
### R9M & R9M Lite
The R9M and R9M Lite can be flashed in a similar way to their corresponding RXes. Using an `OpenTX` transmitter, you flash the bootloader, and then flash ELRS.

Here is a quick 2 minute demo if you would rather watch a video than read the steps:

To do this you need a new version of OpenTX - you can either use the ELRS fork or a nightly build: <a href="/faq/#why-do-i-need-to-update-opentx">FAQ: Why do I need a custom version of OpenTX?</a>

- Currently, the most stable version of OpenTX to use with ExpressLRS is 2.3.10 ExpressLRS version found here: [ExpressLRS OpenTX 2.3.10](https://github.com/ExpressLRS/ExpressLRS/tree/250-500-race-modes/OpenTX)
- If your radio isn't supported by the 2.3.10 ExpressLRS Binaries, your next best option at the moment is the OpenTX Nightly. Using the [OpenTX Nightly Companion Software](https://www.open-tx.org/2019/05/17/2.3-nightlies), download the .bin file

Flash the bin to your radio using normal OpenTX updating protocols (remember to back everything up!)

Then, with your new version of OpenTX, copy [`r9m_elrs_bl.frk`](https://github.com/ExpressLRS/ExpressLRS/blob/master/src/bootloader/r9m_elrs_bl.frk?raw=true) onto the SD card of your radio, in the `/FIRMWARE` folder.

Flash `r9m_elrs_bl.frk` (14kb) to your TX module:

  * Navigate in OpenTX to the TOOLS menu (hold SYS button)
  * Page to the SD-HC CARD page, then the `FIRMWARE` folder
  * Flash the frk file by holding OK and selecting "Flash external module"

**Done! Continue to the next page to set up your user defines.**

### R9M Lite Pro
The R9M Lite Pro must be flashed using STLINK. This is non-reversible and requires an `STLink v2`. 
That means solder your STLINK to `+ = 3v3`, `- = GND`, `C = CLK` and `D = DIO`. (`-` may also be labeled as `G`). This does not require a seperate bootloader step, so **continue to the next page to set up your user defines.** The flashing process will flash the bootloader as well as the firmware.

## Ghost Hardware
Here is a 10 minute video, showing the steps required to both flash the bootloader and the ELRS firmware itself.

Flashing the Ghost RX's is currently a **1 WAY** flash once you flash ExpressLRS to the TX you **will not** be able to use them with stock Ghost RX's (running stock firmware, they **will work** while running ELRS).  You will need a `StLink V2` to flash the TX

Wire `3.3v`, `GND`, `CLK`, and `DIO` to their respective pins on your part from the StLink. (You can power with the StLink but in the first two image the radio is used to power the module).

**Done! You're ready to set up your user defines and flash the firmware to your Ghost hardware**

## Jumper R900 Mini
This also requires an STLink, so the wiring is as follows: 
Wire `3.3v`, `GND`, `CLK` (C), and `DIO` (D) to their respective pins on the RX from the StLink.
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ExpressLRS/ExpressLRS-hardware/master/img/r900mini-rx/r900mini-side2-closeup.jpg" width = "60%">

Because those pins are so small one option is to only solder a wire on the `CLK` and `DIO` then power it with the 5v pin with an external power source. 

**Done! You're ready to set up your user defines and flash the firmware to your R900mini**
