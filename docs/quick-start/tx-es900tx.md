## ES900TX

### Flashing via Wifi

Target: `HappyModel_TX_ES900TX_via_WIFI`

With the correct target selected and [Firmware Options](../../quick-start/firmware-options) set, **Build** your firmware using the ExpressLRS Configurator. Once it's done, it should open the Target folder for you where the `firmware.bin` file is. Do not close this window so you can easily locate the correct file to upload to the module.

The next steps will require the [ELRS Lua Script](https://github.com/ExpressLRS/ExpressLRS/blob/master/src/lua/ELRS.lua?raw=true) (right-click, save as). Download the ELRS.lua script and save it to your Radio's `/Scripts/Tools` folder. Insert/attach your module into your module bay and make sure it's not loose and there's proper connection with the radio. Execute the ELRS.lua script by pressing "System Menu" in your radio and then under Tools, select ELRS.lua.

At first, it will show "Mismatch"; it's normal. Tap `Enter` once on your radio to "Force Use" the script. If it's showing a "Connecting" message, then recheck the connection of the module to your radio.

Select "Wifi Update" from the lua script. The Lua script will instruct you to go to a specific Ip Address, but you have to first connect to the Wifi Hotspot it created. It will show up in your network as `ExpressLRS TX Module`, and the password is simply `expresslrs`.

Using your browser, navigate to the correct page (typically http://10.0.0.1/) and it should show an upload form (you will have to scroll down a bit). You can drag-and-drop the `HappyModel_TX_ES900TX-<version>.bin` file that the ExpressLRS Configurator created. You can also click the `Choose File` button and navigate to the folder where the firmware was created. Ensure that you have selected the correct firmware file and click `Update`.

Once the file is uploaded, the webserver should load a White page, with the message **Update Success! Rebooting...**

As it rebooted, the connection to the Webserver got terminated. Verify with the [ELRS.lua](../../quick-start/tx-prep/#troubleshooting-lua-script) script if you have successfully updated your module using the Git commit hash for the firmware version you have on the module.

#### Method 2

With the correct target selected and [Firmware Options](/quick-start/firmware-options) set, **Build** your firmware using the ExpressLRS Configurator. Once it's done, it should open the Target folder for you where the `HappyModel_TX_ES900TX-<version>.bin` file is. Do not close this window so you can easily locate the correct file to upload to the module.

Using the [ELRS Lua Script](https://github.com/ExpressLRS/ExpressLRS/blob/master/src/lua/ELRS.lua?raw=true) (right-click, save as), select `Wifi Update` and if you have flashed your Tx Module with your Home WiFi Network details, it will connect to the network automatically.

Using your browser, navigate to http://elrs_tx.local and the WiFi Update page should show up. Scroll down towards the Firmware Update section, as shown below:

![Firmware Update](../assets/images/web-firmwareupdate.png)

Drag-and-drop the `HappyModel_TX_ES900TX-<version>.bin` file created by the ExpressLRS Configurator into the Choose File field, or manually navigate to the Folder by clicking the `Choose File` button. Once the correct file is selected, click the `Update`. Wait for the process to complete, and the module will reboot (~2-3min). Using the [ELRS.lua](/quick-start/tx-prep/#troubleshooting-lua-script) script, verify that you have the latest version.

#### Method 3

Using the [ELRS Lua Script](https://github.com/ExpressLRS/ExpressLRS/blob/master/src/lua/ELRS.lua?raw=true) (right-click, save as), select `Wifi Update` and if you have flashed your Tx Module with your Home WiFi Network details, it will connect to the network automatically.

Using the ExpressLRS Configurator, select the correct Target and set your [Firmware Options](/quick-start/firmware-options). Click **Build and Flash** and wait for the compile process to complete. You should see a section as pictured below and the Success message marking the update process complete.

Using the [ELRS.lua](/quick-start/tx-prep/#troubleshooting-lua-script) script, verify that you have the latest version.

### Flashing via USB

Target: `HappyModel_TX_ES900TX_via_UART`

This method requires you move two jumpers into specific pins in the module board. See the following image for the jumper location and which pin should be bridged for this method to work.

![JumperES900](../assets/images/Jumper-es900tx.jpg)

The 2 bottom-most dipswitch should be moved into the position as shown in the image above. Attach your USB cable into the module and your computer. [CP210x Drivers](https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers) will have to be installed for this to work properly (Windows). Make sure your computer recognizes the module as a USB-to-UART Bridge device, otherwise, this method will not work.

Using the ExpressLRS Configurator with the correct Target selected and [options](../../quick-start/firmware-options) set, hit **Build & Flash**. Wait for the process to finish, and you should be greeted with the "Success" message.

Assemble the module back together and attach it to your radio module bay and verify with the [ELRS.lua](../../quick-start/tx-prep/#troubleshooting-lua-script) script if you have successfully updated your module using the Git commit hash for the firmware version you have on the module.

## ES915/868TX (Discontinued)

### Flashing via OpenTX

Target: `HappyModel_TX_ES915TX_via_stock_BL`

Using **Build** in the ExpressLRS Configurator, wait for the firmware to be compiled. After that's done, ExpressLRS Configurator Log should show the `Success` Message, and it will automatically open the folder where the **firmware.elrs** can be found. Put (copy-paste) the firmware.elrs to your Radio's SD Card (preferably to the `/FIRMWARE` folder for easy access). Once on your radio, navigate to the `/FIRMWARE` folder, select the firmware.elrs and click-hold the Enter button and select "Flash External ELRS".

Wait for the flashing to finish, module will reboot and you should hear the tune and two beeps (if external module is now set to CRSF protocol).

### Flashing via STLink

Target: `HappyModel_TX_ES915TX_via_STLINK`

Connect your STLink v2 to the pads shown on the image below.

![ES915tx](../assets/images/ES915tx.jpg)

With the module connected shown above, and your configuration set, hit **Build & Flash** in the ExpressLRS Configurator and wait for the process to finish. Once that's done, and the Success Message showing, you can now remove/unsolder the STLink, and re-assemble the module, and put it into your Radio's Module Bay. The ExpressLRS tune should play and then two beeps after that can be heard.

Verification can be done using the ELRS.lua script. It should show the Version Hash at the top, as well as the options you can set. If it's showing "Connecting", check if External Module is set to CRSF for the selected model in your radio, and that internal RF module is set to off. See general Troubleshooting section for other ways to determine your module is flashed and ready for flying.
