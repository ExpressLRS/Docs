# Partners program

Interested in developing ExpressLRS-compatible hardware or collaborating with our project?

We welcome partnerships with manufacturers who are committed to quality and innovation in RC systems. To begin working
with the ExpressLRS development team, simply email us at info@expresslrs.org.

Once we receive your inquiry, our team will establish a direct line of communication to discuss your project and outline
the next steps. We’ll work with you throughout the process to ensure a smooth path to compatibility and official
support.

Let’s build something great together.
